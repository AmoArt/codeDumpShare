_sc_00001 (village, late morning/noon day 8)


[m] Ponyville.

[bb] "What do you mean, you don't have the Elements of Harmony?"

[m] The Mayor was probably regretting submitting to his requests. She cringed away –

[m] bb thundered, stamping a hoof against the edge of his chariot hard enough to crack a wheel. 
[m] six mares in front of him, 
[m] the crowd of gawking – and growing – onlookers. Even that cross-eyed pegasus was staring.

[bb] "You six ARE the gods damned Elements of Harmony!" he yelled, 
[bb] "What? Did you lose yourselves?" 
[m] He stomped again, utterly enraged. 
[bb] "Sell your souls maybe?!"

[m] he had assembled the six fillies in the town square. He couldn't care less what else the - village saw or thought. 

[ts] "Prince Blueblood." Twilight – 
[m] stood next to a cowering golden pegasus who looked ready to bolt in fright. 
[ts] "Princess Celestia has the Elements now. We can't use them without her giving them to us."

[bb] "No. No. No. No! NO!" 
[m] he corrected her, pointing accusingly with a shaking hoof. 
[bb] "Do not tell me that. Do not tell me you don't have the bloody Elements. I need YOU –" 
[m] He pointed at each of them in turn. 
[bb] "– To. BLAST. ME!"

[m] The six mares all exchanged looks of worry.

[bb] "Hit me with a rainbow! Bombard me with sparkles!" 
[m] He all but pounded his hoof into his chest. 
[bb] "Drown me in light! Use the magic of Friendship! Do something!"

[m] The pink one wound her hoof around and crossed her eyes comically. 
[pp] "And ponies call ME crazy!"

[m] Blueblood screamed.


_sc_00002 (dining hall, morning day 9++)

[bb] "Auntie. Out of curiosity, do you have the Elements of Harmony?"
- - -
[bb] "Auntie. I've heard from your student, Twilight Sparkle, that you've sequestered the Elements of Harmony somewhere safe? I don't suppose you could –"
- - -
[bb] "It has come to my attention recently that –"
- - -
[bb] "Auntie, if I could just –"
- - -
[bb] "Princess Celestia, Auntie, please – !"

_sc_00003 (gala front entrance balcony, evening,  day 14)


"At the Gala. At the Gala.
"At the Gala, in the garden. I'm going to see them all. All the creatures. I'll befriend them at the Gala.
"At the Gala. All the birdies and the critters. They will love me, big and small. We'll become good friends forever. Right here at the Gala.
"All our dreams will come true. Right here at the Gala. At the Gala.

"At the Gala. It's amazing. I will sell them. That you heard of. All my appletastic treats. Yummy, yummy. Hungry ponies. Give us samples. They will buy them. We will buy them. Caramel apples, apple sweets. Gimme some."

[m] (bb is drained of cares to give)


"Into the Gala, meet new friends. Into the Gala, sell some apples. Into the Gala, find my prince. Prove I'm as great as a Wonderbolt. To meet. To sell. To find. To prove. To woo. To talk."
"Into the Gala. Into the Gala. And we'll have the best night ever." He repeated, even though he could barely hear the words of the ponies below. "At the Gala."

[m] (internal thoughts on if one of them got what they wanted, the others didn’t)

[m] Prince Blueblood took a deep breath, exhaled, and tossed himself off the highest tower in Canterlot.


_sc_00004 (bedchamber, early morning,  day 15)

[m] (song)

[m] The radio died as Blueblood swatted it off his dresser, tearing out the power cord.


_sc_00004+ (bedchamber, early morning,  day 16)

[m] (song)

[m] A heavy hoof descended, smashing the accursed contraption with a squeal.


_sc_00004+ (bedchamber, early morning,  day 17)

[m] (song)

[bb] "RAAAGH!"

[m] A magical glow wrapped around the radio, crushing it into a ball of crumpled metal and splintering wood.


_sc_00005 (gala garden (other angle), afternoon,  day 18)

[m] (maybe get the scene more kino like, on top of tower ?)

[Cel] "Blueblood!" Celestia roared, 
[Cel] "What do you think you're doing?! What have you done?!"

[m] Canterlot Palace was burning.

[m] The Royal Guards were staring, slack jawed and dumbstruck, 
[m] at the evil purple and green fire as it merrily danced from tower to tower, spire to spire, consuming everything. 
[m] Pegasi were in the air, circling like frantic buzzards – trying feverishly to use clouds and rain to put out the blaze. 

[m] Canterlot was burning, and no pony could save it.

[m] Blueblood laughed, standing amid the flames. A circle of magic kept him safe, for a time.

[bb] "No more Galas!" 
[m] he roared over the magical dragon flames and enchanted fire. 
[bb] "This was the only way to be sure! No more! Never again!"

[Cel] "Gods and stars, Nephew!" 
[m] Celestia took to the air, tried to reach for him with her magic  –

[m] bb already felt the green fire, dancing up his legs – so warm!

[m]  guests who had arrived early could only watch, stunned, dumbstruck as the Light that was Canterlot became a demonic bonfire. 
[m] The incantations and forbidden scrolls spoke of a fire that would burn for eleven days and eleven nights; 


_sc_00006 (bedchamber, early morning,  day 19)

[m] (song)

[m] (scene of bb having all hope drained from him?)
[m] (do the below bathtub scene here?)

_sc_00006+ (bedchamber, early morning,  day 20)

[m] (song)

[m] bb sat, stiff and silent, as Light Touch and Sandy got him ready for breakfast. 

[m] He thought briefly about asking one of them to draw the water for the tub again. It was one of the quicker ways to end his day. There was an expensive hair dryer at hoof that did the job very well. Of course, all it would have done would be to send him back to where he was a few minutes ago.


[m]  Light Touch peeked from behind the mirror she held up for him. 
[oc-2] "Prince Blueblood?"

[bb] "Yes. Yes." 
[bb] He slowly snapped out of the stupor. 
[bb] "This is fine. Thank you, Light Touch."

[oc-2] "Um. Thank you, sir." 
[m] The chamber maid bowed, surprised as always to be complimented on her work. Or even addressed.

[bb] "There isn't anything I could ever say just to put you at ease, is there?" he asked, knowing the answer already.

[oc-2] "I am at ease, my Lord," Light Touch lied, and bowed more deeply. 
[m] Sandy, as always, did the same. 
[oc-2] "We both are."

[m] Blueblood nodded. There was nothing more to say.

_sc_00007 (diner hall, morning,  day 20)

[m]  Celestia was calmly eating her oats and apples
[m] Luna was finishing her dinner and sipping from her wine glass. 
[m] Proper Place was occupying a place of honor next to the empty chair where Blueblood traditionally sat. As ordained, he took his place, a ticking gear in a broken clock.

[m] Tea, milk, ginger.
[m] He finished and left early.

_sc_00007 (hall, late evening,  day 20)

[m] Luna walked the same route as always, back to her private chamber.

[m]  Her stature had improved, and her hair was beginning to return to it's ethereal state.

[m] There was neither anything to bemoan nor anything to be excited about. It was a nice medium; a pleasant middle ground. It worked. 
[m] Her guards stiffened at her sides, pausing.

[m]  it was Blueblood. Was he lost? He was standing in the middle of the hall, blocking the way. 
[m] Now, he looked... weary.

[bb] "Auntie Luna," 
[bb]"What... what is it like?" he asked, 
[m]looking at her with desperate eyes. 
[bb]"To be immortal?"

[m] Luna blinked, finding the question both odd and unexpected.

[Lun] "Why are you asking us that?"

[bb] "I guess, the bigger question is," 
[bb] , "when you're destined to live forever, what do you do with your life? Besides what you have to? How do you live with it?"

[b] Luna considered the question, and how to reply. She opened her mouth –

[bb] "One simply does," he guessed. 
[bb] "That's what you were about to say, isn't it?"

[m] The Princess of the Moon raised a hoof to her chin.

[Lun] "It... was, yes," 
[m] she answered, and explained a bit more, feeling the impulse to at least provide some new insight, however enigmatic. 
[Lun] "Immortality is something you endure. It is a blessing in some ways, but a curse in others."

[m]  did not expect to ever hear.

[bb] "I think I'm immortal." He stated it with a measure of despair. 
[bb] "Not like you or Auntie Celestia," he quickly elaborated. 
[bb] "A different immortal. Every day... every day is the same for me. I can't die. I can't stop it. Isn't that what it means to be immortal? Is this what it's like?"

[m] Luna's expression darkened, expecting a joke of some kind. A poor one.
[m] One of her guards was less reserved. He snorted dismissively at the statement, nostrils flaring.

[bb] "You think it's funny, don't you?" Blueblood asked, not with malice. 
[m] He simply sounded detached, despite the insult. 
[bb] "I guess it is kind of funny. Who would believe a crazy story like that?"

[m] The Prince sighed and shook his head.

[oc-bat1] "Not like believing you saw a hippocamp when you were six, and refusing to go into the water or even take a bath for the next ten years."

[m] The guard stiffened, and very quietly laughed. 
[oc-bat1] "I don't know what you’re talking about, Lord Prince. Sea Ponies..." 
[m] He couldn't suppress a traumatic, visceral shudder. 
[oc-bat1] "They're not real. Just... old mare's tales. They're not real."

[bb] "Wrath, I'm guessing you didn't hear that one about your partner?" 
[m] Blueblood asked the other guard, tilting his head to the side in faux curiosity. 
[bb] "Well, you've only been teamed up for a month and five days, and you didn't even talk to one another until two days after that. Not to mention that you didn't get along very well with your last partner in the Royal Guard. The one who didn't want to work with you because he found out you liked stallions as well as mares?"

[m] The guard to Luna's left actually trotted back a step in shock.

[oc-bat1] "What?" he growled. "H-how do you...? How could you...?"

[bb] "You don't need to worry," the Prince assured him with a hollow, emotionless grin. 
[bb] "Despite his phobia of aquatic ponies, Fury here's already heard the rumors and decided they don't matter."

[bb] "Isn't that nice? Goodwill among Auntie Luna's bodyguards. Oh, and a pair of strong wings to pull that bat-themed chariot the Princess is trying to build in secret. The one she has in her cave beneath Canterlot? Isn't that a bit tacky, Auntie?"

[m] Luna was gaping now, but quickly comported herself.

[Lun] "How... do you know about that?" she asked, not letting her regal veil slip, despite the near gaffe. 
[Lun] "Even Celestia doesn't know... so... how?"

[bb] "I've had time to learn a lot of things," 
[bb] "Boredom will do that to a pony. Once he gets tired of thinking up new ways to kill himself."

[Lun] "Or perhaps," 
[Lun] "you're using some sort of spell to read minds?"

[bb] "On those two?" 
[m] He pointed at the pair of guards. 
[bb] "Maybe. On you, Auntie? Do you really think I could?" 
[m] He tapped the front edge of his hoof on the floor, the equivalent of a finger-snap. 
[bb] "Oh, but I forgot. You don't like being called 'Auntie.' You could just have said so, you know. I'd have stopped."

[m] At her sides, the two Royal Guards looked to each other, and then to her, for orders. Or at least an explanation.

[bb]"I could go on, if you need more convincing,"
[bb] "I know almost everyone in the palace by this point."

[Lun] "How much,"
[Lun] "How much do you know about us?"

[m] bb dipped his head in respect.

[bb] "Not that much," he readily admitted. 
[bb] "You don't like to talk about your past. The easiest way to get information out of you is to rile you up and make you angry. Or indignant."

[Lun] "Then why?" 
[Lun] "Why approach us now with this? Why not Celestia?"

[bb] "What makes you think I haven't tried?"
[bb] "Besides, I've seen how my Auntie deals with her immortal life. I don't think I can live like that. I don't... I don't even want to be like this. I think you're the only one who can keep me from going completely insane. Please."

[bb] "Please," 
[m] he asked again, and lowered onto his hooves, his head and horn brushing the floor. 
[bb] "Please believe me."

[m] He remained there, bowing more deeply than Luna remembered seeing a pony bow. Not since a thousand years ago.

[Lun] "Guards," she said, and then raised her voice, more authoritatively.
[Lun] "Leave us. We would have words with our... nephew." 
[m] Seeing the pair tense, she added the caveat, 
[Lun] "And tell no one of what you have heard here. Understood?"

[oc-bats] "Yes, Princess!" her two guards replied in stereo.

[m] The hastened to leave, and only the pair of Royals remained.

[Lun] "We..." Luna corrected herself. 
[Lun] "I... am listening."

_sc_00008  (Observatory, late evening,  day 21)

[m] (this will need to broken into few individual scenes)

[m] They ended up at the Royal Observatory.

[m]  where Luna spent every Gala night. 

[m] walls were covered in diagrams of the various malleable stellar phenomenon, most prominently a nebula that Luna was planning to move over the new few months to free up some bright but normally obscured stars. There were paintings of the moon next to hoof-sketched layouts of the moon, made by Luna herself. With her 'face' gone from the night sky, the full moon was too bare for her liking. She intended to phase in new 'mares' or dark seas as a replacement over the next ten years.

[m] Blueblood recognized the passion and artistic obsession in the many layouts and prints, many marked with tiny, fine notes on the margins and lines and arrows and corrections and redactions and re-corrections. 
[m] she had repurposed the old Observatory as her atelier.
[m] He even suggested using the term, an idea that drew polite chuckles.

[Lun] "Atelier?"
[Lun] "Is that not a bit pretentious?"

[bb] "Normally it would be,"
[bb] "But in this case, I think it fits."

[m] Outside, fireworks exploded as the Gala roared into full swing. That musical number from every Gala opening could be just barely heard through the intervening distance and open windows. 
[m] It had driven Blueblood nearly to madness before, but for the first time in a long time, he felt almost at ease. 
[m] He smirked as his dart landed soundly in the center of the crudely drawn target circle.

[Lun] "How doest thou manage that?" Luna grumbled, her old Equinese slipping in as she grew frustrated.

[m] Her royal highness glared balefully at the feathered dart resting in the cup of her bare hoof. 
[m] Green eyes fixated on the concentric circles, and foregoing magic – that would be cheating! – Luna huffed as she threw. The dart overshot, hitting the outermost edge of the cardboard bullseye.

[Lun] "Blast!"

[bb] "Now, now, you aren't throwing a rock," 
[bb] "Visualize it and make an easy, flowing movement."

[m] Blueblood picked up another blue feathered dart, and flicked it. Not even very quickly, it seemed to leisurely drift through the air to land on target, right next to one of its fellows, smack dab in the center. 
[m] Luna glowered playfully, and tried again, with much less force.
[m] It took a little while, but finally she got one near-center.

[Lun] "Huzzah!" 
[m] She threw up her hooves in triumph. 
[Lun] "Tis not so difficult!"

[m] Blueblood just sat on his haunches and laughed with her. 
[bb] "You'll get the hang of it, eventually."

[Lun] "This is a... pegasi game, is it?" 
[m] Luna asked, sticking out her tongue as she concentrated on repeating her feat.

[bb] "It's a common game among the low classes. I just learned it from two pegasi."

[Lun] "That would be the two Wonderbolts?"

[bb] "Soarin’ and Spitfire,"
[bb] "Sometimes I sneak them out of the Gala to have fun in town. It took a lot of practice before I got as good at it as they are." 
[m] His shoulders trembled as he chuckled. 
[bb] "I also learned how to mix my own drinks. Let me tell you, that one skill has come in handy."

[Lun] "The proud Prince of Equestria, mixing drinks and slumming with commoners," Luna remarked, amused by the image.

[m] Her next throw was close, but a little off target.

[Lun] "...But we are curious." 
[Lun]  "Do you ever tell them who you are?"

[bb] "Are you suggesting our subjects would not recognize us?" Blueblood declared in a grandiose voice, hoof to his chest.

[m] Luna rolled her eyes in exasperation. 
[Lun] "We are suggesting you could hardly stand to not have them recognize you."

[bb] "Is that so?" he inquired, chest still puffed out in regal indignation.

[Lun] "You possess an ego the size of Everfree itself, and you know it."

[bb] "Well, since I am the pony who decides the borders of Everfree, there is some truth to that," 
[bb] "When I go out with Spitfire and Soarin’, I usually try not to draw attention to myself. But... sometimes... it is cathartic to make a scene."

[Lun] "Is it...?" 
[m]Luna hesitated to ask, momentarily glancing towards one of the windows and the Gala beyond. 
[Lun] "Is it amusing to be among the common folk? So very much has changed in a thousand years... the classes commingle more than I ever believed possible.

[Lun] "Before today," she said with some embarrassment, 
[Lun] "I never would have imagined you, of all ponies, to partake of such activities."

[bb] "I never would have, before," 
[m] bb admitted, picking up another dart and examining the needle-tip. 
[bb] "Not only didn't I have any interest in such things... it would have been improper to do so. I have spent my entire life cultivating my image. As Blueblood."

[m] He touched the sharpened tip to his other hoof, just enough to pinch the skin a little, but not draw blood.

[bb] "Equestria's most handsome stallion. Canterlot's most eligible bachelor. Most untouchable and unassailable noblepony."

[m] He threw the dart with long practiced ease, wedging it between three others of the same color.

[bb] "I never really thought I'd accomplish anything, and I never felt like trying. Looking good was enough. When the time came to retire, I'd arrange a marriage with some attractive younger mare and just fade away. Like every Blueblood does. I'm just number fifty-two... unless the royal genealogists somehow slipped up somewhere. Not even a memorable number, like fifty, or sixty. Fifty-two.

[bb] "But now, none of that really matters."  
[m] He said it with a wan, weak smile. 
[bb] "Tomorrow, you'll forget we talked until you fell asleep, and played darts at night after you woke up. You'll look at me over the breakfast table, and wonder quietly how you could be even remotely related to me."

[Lun] "Nephew..." 
[m] she began to protest, placing a hoof on his front leg.

[bb] "It's alright," 
[bb] "That's just how things are. I said earlier that maybe I was immortal, but maybe the truth is that I'm not even here? When you can't live and you can't die, and nothing you do changes anything around you, can you really say that you exist? I used to laugh at funny questions like that when I was a foal."

[m] Blueblood tossed the next dart. Bullseye. 
[bb] "I don't know anymore."

[m]  taken aback, he felt her pull him into a familial hug. Luna was not Celestia's size, not yet anyway, and he was large even for a stallion so they generally stood shoulder to shoulder. 
[m] he reflexively tensed at the front legs around him. Luna herself didn't seem entirely comfortable with familiar contact, and soon let him go, looking away in growing abashment.

[Lun] "We don't know..." 
[Lun]  "Maybe our advice isn't the best. This was why we didn't want to give it before."

[m] She smoothed back some of her mane and nodded to herself.

[Lun] "But," 
[Lun] "you should endure." 
[Lun] "And adapt. And grow. You do exist, nephew. My own immortality has cost me everything but what I have with me now." 
 
[m]She gestured to herself. 
[Lun] "And my dear sister, too, thank the heavens. The only thing we can do, as ponies, is move forward."

[bb] "Move forward?" he asked, snorting in dismissal. 
[bb] "How? How can you?"
 
[Lun] "Even if it doesn't seem like it," 
[m]she told him, bracing her hooves on his shoulders. 
[Lun] "Every day is an opportunity. No matter how bleak it looks at first."

[bb] "If you say so, Princess."

[Lun] "You can call us Luna, you know." She sighed, softly. 
[Lun] "We would like it if more ponies just called us Luna."

[m] (new scene? Add the fs shout here, happening in the far distance?)

[m] The Gala was a disaster. Again.

[m]  They stayed up playing inane games and pointedly not discussing the subject of immortality. 
[m] The moon was full and high, and after a time Blueblood escaped the tower to track down some coffee to stay awake. Luna had suggested just getting a servant to do it, but he also took it as an excuse to stretch his legs.
[m] He returned with a steaming pot from the pantry. 
[m] Luna found the taste rather foul, and said as much, but Blueblood downed as much as he could. Next time, he told her, he would bring milk and crème.

[m] They talked about stars and moons and maps and cutie marks.
[m] And then it was over.


_sc_00009  (bedchamber, early morning,  day 22)

[m] (song)

[m] Blueblood was back in bed. His eyes opened and he lingered a few seconds longer than usual before kicking off his covers and rolling off and onto the floor. It was a new day.
[m] A new day.

[m] (Maybe start or the end here would be a good point to crop the chapter?)
[m] (and add a spoken word from bb to indicate that he will stop the nihilistic outlook? Or like sunlight ray shining on his face differently?)
[m] (or have this scene played as the end with bb siting up in kind of hope feel like, than on new part, have replay the freeze frame of last few seconds of it?)
---new part---

_sc_00010  (garden, early afternoon,  day 22)


[mule] "Excuse me, but I'm a bit hard'a hearin'... ya want to do what now?"

[bb] "I would like to know about the Royal Gardens," 
[m] He leaned closer to the old goat of a gardener. 
[bb] "If you would, please."

[m] His saddlebags were stocked with books - history, design and influences of the Great Gardens of Canterlot.

[mule] "I'm not sure how much I can tell ya that those books there won't," 
[m] the groundskeeper replied, tipping his hat respectfully. He was a scruffy looking specimen himself, with a well worn, almost invisible brown cutie mark.

[m] The Prince levitated out a guide, filled with bookmarks, and opened it to one of the pages.

[bb] "You could start by identifying which animals in this book are the most commonly seen close to the Palace. I'm also curious what would happen if some of the Gala guests tonight tried to chase or catch the animals?"

[mule] "Ooh?" 
[m] The groundskeeper scratched his mane as he thought about that. 
[mule] "Well, that probably wouldn't be too good. So, um... I guess ya want to start with the birds?"

[bb] "That would be a good place to start,"

[bb]  "Let's start with the birds."

_sc_00011  (dine hall, morning,  day 23)

[m] Blueblood set down his cup – tea, milk and ginger – and glanced across the table.

[bb] "Auntie," he spoke up, his tone amiable. 
[bb] "I was wondering how your student in Ponyville has been doing. Twilight Sparkle, if I recall. She's still sending you reports on the magic of friendship, isn't she?"

[m] In a rare display of bewilderment, Celestia stared at her nephew.

[Cel] "Yes, she is," 
[Cel] "May I ask why the sudden interest?"

[bb]  "She's obviously someone very important to you, Auntie. And, to hear you speak of her, she must be quite the filly. It's only natural I'm a bit curious. Besides," 
[bb], "I'll probably meet her at the Gala tonight."

[Cel] "You actually met her before, once." 
[Cel]  "But you were both too young to remember."

[bb] "No time like the present, then."

[Cel] "I suppose you're right," 
[Cel]  "Very well."


_sc_00012  (Academy + inside office, afternoon,  day 23)

[m] (grand academy building? Scene outside than inside office?)
[m] (somehow mention his charity work, and pulling strings?)
[m] Certainly, none of them would have expected him to start pulling strings and cashing in favors. 
[m] Funding was always in short supply somewhere. Always.

[oc-prof] "Teleportation," 
[m] the wrinkled old pony grumbled, shaking his head. 
[oc-prof] "You?"

[bb] "Come now, I didn't do that badly in class," Blueblood objected.

[oc-prof] "You blinked two hoof-lengths and threw up all over yourself!"

[oc-prof] "You have no talent for blinking, much less long range teleportation," Whitemane continued, snorting rudely and dismissively.
[oc-prof]  "That great big horn on your head may as well be a tumor for all the good it does you."

[bb] "Be that as it may." Blueblood chafed at the old goat's typical insults.
[bb] "I have been studying the subject and..."

[oc-prof]  "You? Studying?" Whitemane cut him off, and spat. Actually spat.

[bb] "Yes. Me. Studying." 
[m] The Prince of Equestria grimaced at the spittle that had very nearly nicked his left hoof. 
[bb] "Now, I happen to be making a rather substantial grant to the Academy, but I require a learned mind to assist me..."

[oc-prof]  "In learning to teleport without soiling yourself?"

[bb] "In... that. Yes."

[oc-prof]  "What a waste of time," 
[m] the aged unicorn grumbled, but rolled his eyes, at least willing to give it a try. 
[oc-prof]  "Very well, show me what you've supposedly learned, and I'll take a few minutes to point out how poor you are at it."

_sc_00013 (music theatre , afternoon,  day 24)

[m] (need to get some sound alike music for the background, similar from show gala)
[m]  Canterlot Chamber Orchestra company was really quite good.

[m]  Blueblood listened to them now while he studied, one of only three ponies in the audience. 
[m] He jotted down some notes for the future.
[m] Their new cellist was rather pretty as well.


_sc_00014 (Academy office , afternoon,  day 25)

[oc-prof]  "Out of breath already? You know your father, bless his soul, managed twice that distance with half the effort. To think the royal bloodline has become so weak, I weep for Equestria. Not that we need a royal bloodline with not just one but two immortal Princesses on the throne."

[m] bb coughed hard, trying to recover from the short blink across the lecture stage.

[oc-prof]  "I can't imagine why you're wasting your time with this," 
[m] pacing now and stroking his beard. 
[oc-prof]  "Your magical tunneling projection is the most pathetic I've seen in years. My great grandson just got his cutie mark a month ago, and he could do better. You need to tighten up your Star Field. And, for Celestia's sake, stop inhaling when you teleport. Only teleport on an exhale! Were you born this incompetent or do you work at it?"

_sc_00015 (garden , afternoon,  day 26)

[m] He sucked in the fresh, morning air.

[m] The entire garden, radiating outward from the three wings of the Ménagerie, was a diamond within a star within a diamond. It literally morphed in shape and color as the seasons changed: the evergreen outlines and contours becoming more distinct as deciduous trees and bushes shed their leaves. It was a living mural the likes of which dwarfed any of the grand tapestries, vestments or statues on display inside.

[m] Blueblood hardly minded the looks of surprise on passing faces as he worked, cutting away bits of shrubbery, manipulating three different sizes of shears in midair. 
[m] For some odd reason, a tune he couldn't quite remember the words for hovered in the back of his mind, compelling him to hum to himself as he worked. Ah, or maybe it was just an addictive tune he had picked up from Green Thumb?

[bb] "Green Thumb!" 
[m] He spied the groundskeeper happily sweeping away a few leaves. 
[m] He loudly hummed the tune. 
[bb] "Do you know a song with that cadence?"

[mule] "Yeah, yeah, Ah think Ah know that one." 
[m] He leaned heavily on his rake. 
[mule] "Art of the... Art of the something."

[bb] "I find it annoyingly catchy."

[mule] "Yep."

_sc_00016 (library , afternoon,  day 27)

The Royal Librarian sat up straight in shock.

[oc-lib] "Prince Blueblood!"
[oc-lib]  "What are you... I mean, how can I help...?"

[bb] "Don't worry about it, Thistle." 
[m] He trotted by her to check out more books, levitating a dozen colored bookmarks from a cup on his way past.
[m] "I know what I'm here for. Yes, everything's fine. No, this is just a private matter. Yes, I'll keep quiet. No, I won't be needing to make any copies. Also, can you have someone refill the coffee machine around ten o'clock?"

[m] The charcoal gray mare blinked. A few times.

[bb] "Oh, and have them bring out fresh milk and crème, while they're at it. The stock in the backroom has spoiled." 
[m]He waved back at her as he went about his business. 
[bb] "Ta!"

[oc-lib]  "Um..." 
[m] She scratched behind her ear. 
[oc-lib]  "Yes... sir?"

_sc_00017 (academy office , afternoon,  day 28)

[oc-prof] "Oh ho? Since when could you project through walls?"
[m] Whitemane almost – almost – sounded impressed.

[m] Blueblood grinned as he looked up at the old master.
[bb] "I... did say I've been stud –"

[oc-prof] "Don't go clopping yourself off already, colt," the grizzled Professor snapped, cutting him off. 
[oc-prof] "Your distance is still subpar. And could you possibly bleed off more magic when you use that oversized pig-sticker on your forehead? What, do you think you're made of magic? Sloppy. Sloppy! And wasteful!"

[m] He groaned painfully.

[oc-prof] "Oh sweet Celestia, you're making me wish I'd retired! Again, colt!" 
[m] Whitemane stomped a withered old hoof. 
[oc-prof] "And do it without making my teeth ache. Are you trying to teleport yourself or blow up the room as you leave?"


_sc_00018 (diner hall , morning,  day 29)


[m] Blueblood hummed happily to himself as he finished his tea (milk, ginger).

[Cel] "My goodness, nephew," 
[m] Celestia remarked, after observing his curiously good mood for a few discreet minutes. 
[Cel] "You do seem quite chipper this morning."

[m] He offered her a mysterious smile.

[bb] "I've been waiting for today,"
[bb] "For quite some time now."

[oc-pp] "For the Gala, you mean?" Proper Place guessed.

[bb] "Yes. The Gala." 
[m] Blueblood clopped his hoof on the table gently. 
[bb] "That reminds me. I'd like to extend two invitations to Stylus, there –" 
[m] He pointed to the Chamberlain's aide, the Keeper of Seals. 
[bb] "He's thinking of proposing to his fiancé, and the Gala is as good a time as any. Just do it before eleven o'clock."

[m] The normally silent aide opened his mouth, but couldn't think of what to say.

[bb] "Yes, I know you two don't have anything to wear," 
[bb]  "I've already sent one of my servants along to find you both something appropriate."

[m]Stylus stammered. 
[oc-pp+] "Sir... h-how...?"

[bb] "Long story. No time." 
[m] Blueblood dabbed his lips with his napkin and pushed away from the table. 
[bb] "If you'll excuse me, everypony, I've got a busy day."


_sc_00019 (village (front of the hall) , late morning,  day 29)

[m] (arrived on chariot, like ts in first ep)
[m] Ponyville.

_sc_00019 (on the way to - ra shop, early afternoon,  day 29)

[m] Softly humming the silly little tune these same mares would sing later tonight before the castle gates

[m] supposedly very generous – according to that Wonderbolt crazy pegasus, the friendship letters he had read, and the others who knew her 
[m] Hence why, theoretically, making Rarity's Gala evening go right was the easiest of the six. All he supposedly had to do was act like she wanted him to act: like a proper Prince and gentlecolt. 

_sc_00020 (ra shop, early afternoon,  day 29)

[m] Blueblood tapped his hoof, waiting for the door to open. 

[m]  The two loaned Royal Guard pegasi who had flown him to Ponyville were milling close by, not guarding him as much as they were the chariot. 
[m] The Prince glanced down at himself and wondered if he had overdressed slightly with the change to formal wear.

[m] Finally, the door opened... and a little filly with a pink and purple two-toned mane appeared.
[m] The two ponies stared for a few seconds.

[bb] "You're not Miss Rarity," 
[m] Blueblood stated, peering at her. 
[bb]"Or are you?"

[ra] "No she isn't!" a voice came from within the Boutique.

[-sb]"I'm Sweetie Belle!"
 The little filly stuck out her hoof, then, thinking better of it, remembered her manners and bowed slightly.

[m] Blueblood stared at the polite little filly.
[m] He... just couldn't help it...

[bb] "I am Prince Blueblood. Tell me, Sweetie Belle, is your mother home?"

[m] (I feel like adding ra poking out of the door with loud “what!” would fit in here)

_sc_00020 (ra shop, early afternoon,  day 30)

[-sb] "I'm Sweetie Belle!" 
[m] just like before, first thought about trying to shake hooves before remembering to bow in greeting

[bb] "I am Prince Blueblood. Tell me, Sweetie Belle, would you like to go to the Gala with me?"

_sc_00020 (ra shop, early afternoon,  day 31)

[-sb] "I'm Sweetie Belle!"

[bb] "I am Prince Blueblood. Tell me, Sweetie Belle, is you sister home? I would dearly like to ask her something."

[m] There: Blueblood felt quite proud. No need to make yet another hard reset of reality.

[-sb] "Oh, um." 
[m] The green eyed filly glanced back at the door, not really sure what to say. 
[-sb] "She's..." 
[m] answered slowly and hesitantly,
[-sb]  "...here."

[bb] "Hm."
[m] Normally, he would have found something to amuse himself while he waited for the lady of the house to put her face on, so to speak. However, he had a lot to do today. Everything had to be ready before the Gala. Even during it. There was a very tight schedule.

[bb] "If you could," 
[m] he asked, floating down a bouquet of flowers 
[bb] "Could you please give these to your sister and ask her if she is amenable to my escorting her to the Gala tonight?"

[m] Sweetie Belle's mouth made an "o" and she giggled like, well, a schoolfilly.

[-sb] "A-mean-i-ble means... what?" she asked innocently, as a vexed sound came from inside.

[bb] "It means consenting," he told her with a friendly smile. 
[bb] "Willing."

[m]  Sweetie Belle stole a look back at the door, 

[-sb] "I'm pretty sure she'll say yes," Sweetie Belle guessed.

[bb] "Good. I was thinking of having a chariot pick her up, but apparently she'd prefer to ride with her friends." 
[m]He shook his head; no need to share that bit of information. 
[bb] "Just tell her to be ready by eight."

[-sb] "Bye!" 
[m] The little filly waved cheerily as he hurried to his next engagement.

[m] The fashionista – part one – was ready.

Magic could do that for a pony. Of course, rumor was that Old Whitemane dabbled in alchemy, and forbidden 'mercury flavored' cupcakes. His name had lately become quite ironic: the Professor was bald, save for the short white beard on his chin.
- Whitemane was notoriously abrasive towards all his students. He treated his apprentices even worse, or so the college rumor mill claimed.
