_sc_00001 ((not sure where to place this), afternoon ,  day 43)
 
 
 
 
[oct] "Five. Four. Three. Two. One."
 
[oct] "Hey!"
 
[m] A velvet glow enveloped the surprised earth pony as Melody found herself yanked back off her hooves, mid-conversation.
[m] It was unmistakably the result of magic, unicorn magic, and just as she started to yell
[m] a large potted plant hit the ground, right where she had been standing.
[m] The mare's shocked expression grew as she realized she could have been under that when it fell.
 
[m] Glaring up, she saw two pegasi looking sheepishly and worriedly down, the pot having slipped through their hooves on the way to the second floor of a nearby building.
[m] Worse, the plant in the pot had been a cactus!
 
[oct] "Who-?"
[m] She glanced around, but didn't see any unicorn stepping forward to claim responsibility for the save.
 
_sc_00002 (village but somewhere near trees?, afternoon,  day 43)
 
 
[m] Blueblood appeared with a pop of arcane magic.
 
[scu] "Waaa!"
 
[m] The sudden weight on his back yelped and he couched his legs to cushion the fall.
 
[bb] "You know, if you're going to practice flying, could you at least do it somewhere with adult supervision?" he grumbled, letting the troublesome foal jump down onto the ground.
 
[scu] "Thanks mister!" The orange filly shook her little wings
[m] tilted her head to the side in puzzlement.
[m] "Do I know you?"
 
[m] He shook his head.
[bb] "I wish you did."
 
[m] She quickly grabbed her red scooter and buzzed off. Literally.
 
[bb] "I'll see you tomorrow, you brat!"
 
 
_sc_00003 (outskirts of village were the cave diamond is, afternoon,  day 43)
 
[m]  playing gofer and guard to the Princess's insufferable nephew,
[m] had rushed them to Ponyville on little-to-no notice at all.
[m] Why, Mercury couldn't imagine.
 
[m]  It also meant that his orders, no matter how loony, had to be followed.
[m] Flying over to tape a surprise ticket to that one weathermare's house had been kind of a waste of time, but harmless and nice enough. He hadn't minded doing that.
 
[m] Sitting on a cloud in the middle of the sky, hiding himself... not even over the damn town.
 
[m] Mercury's ears twitched as he heard a commotion in the bushes below.
[m] Raising his head out of his personal cloud cover, he searched the ground for the source.
[m]  A spark of magic exploded from behind a tree, providing the last positional clue.
 
[tri] "Curse you Twilight Sparkle! This is all your fault!"
 
[m] Taking off and circling around, Mercury saw what had been hidden below.
[m] A baby blue unicorn mare was stomping on the head of a cringing Diamond Dog while two others restrained her by her front legs.
 
[dog] "Stupid pony, can't you just shut up and find jewels?!"
 
[tri] "The Great and Powerful Trixie refuses to waste her natural magical talent digging up rocks!"
 
[m] For a moment – just a moment – Mercury wasn't sure who he should be rescuing.
 
[m]  he dove, twisting into a spiral as he snatched the unicorn out of the hands of her captors.
 
[m]  The other two larger Diamond Dogs barked in outrage at losing their prize, but didn't seem inclined to put up a chase or fight about it.
 
[m] Within seconds, Mercury was high in the air and out of reach anyway.
 
[oc-gua] "I'll have you somewhere safe in a minute, ma'am."
[m] The soft blue unicorn mare in his front legs went rigid for a second, only to relax as she threw her front legs around him, squeezing tightly.
 
[oc-gua] "Ma'am? That's a little tight."
 
[tri] "The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't like heights."
 
[m] He didn't notice her furious blushing until after he tried to drop her off.
 
_sc_00004 (outskirts of village, afternoon,  day 43)
 
 
[m] Blueblood teleported briefly, just in time to relieve his Guard.
 
[bb] "Sorry," he whispered, conspiratorially.
[bb] "But that one was better left to you than me."
 
_sc_00005 (from village to castle, late afternoon,  day 43)
 
 
[m] The six mares left Ponyville in their personal carriage, the result of Sparkle's transformation of an apple.
[m] Blueblood followed ahead in his own chariot at first before motioning for his guards to take to the air.
[m] This close to Canterlot, a procession of carriages were starting to converge along the roads leading to the Palace.
 
[m] One carriage, however, had encountered a spot of trouble.
 
[m] Though an old and dignified heirloom, it had clearly seen better days.
[m] Pulled by two earth ponies, it had not responded well to hitting a divot in the road, causing one of the wooden spokes in the front left wheel to break.
 
[oc-gua] "Sir," one of the Guard pegasi rumbled as Blueblood's chariot came around to land.
 
[bb] "Yes, I know, I've heard it before,"
[m]  it should have been a groan of despair, but there was a small smile on his face.
[m] His horn glowed as he jumped off the back, easily levitating up the afflicted quarter of the old carriage.
[m] A pair of elderly earth ponies stopped their muffled bickering about their plight to look out the stage coach's window.
 
[oc-old1] "My word,"
the old mare of the pair gasped.
[oc-old1] "Is that...?"
 
[m] The old gentlecolt recognized him, too. They both did. Every time.
[oc-old2] "Your Grace...!?"
 
[bb] "Mister and Missus Clover, isn't it?"
[m] , letting his magic do all the actual work.
[m] Already, he had a spare wheel out, just the right size – of course – and screws unwound as he removed the broken one.
[bb] "We can't have ponies late to the Grand Galloping Gala, now can we? Just sit back and relax. I'll be done in a minute."
 
[m] The two earth pony drivers just stared at the royal unicorn like he had more heads than a hydra.
 
[bb] "At the Gala. At the Gala,"
[m] he hummed to himself as he worked.
[bb] "This time. We'll have the best night ever. At the Gala..."
 
 
_sc_00006 (gala front entrance, early evening,  day 43)
 
 
[m] He arrived – naturally – right on time to precede the six mares of honor.
 
[m] stepped off his chariot and took in the magnificent sight of Castle Canterlot, built into the side of the mountain like a hanging garden.
 
[m] Ponies in all their finery stopped to bow graciously at his unannounced entrance.
 
[m] Then, things got interesting, as the crimson red carriage behind his chariot opened.
 
[ts] "I can't believe we're finally here!" Twilight was the first to exclaim.
[m] Almost like magic, other ponies began to draw themselves towards the six mares, mesmerized by some sort of karmic magnetism.
 
[m] . Now, this close to it, he found himself enjoying the spectacle.
 
"All our dreams and our hopes
From now, until here after...
All that we've been wishing for
Will happen at the Gala!
At the Gala!"
 
[m] This time, different than before, that one unicorn singled him out. Flanked by a chorus of ponies – many of whom Blueblood knew by name now – she demurely approached him, singing her verse:
 
"At the Gala, all the royals...
They will meet fair Rarity!
They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala..."
 
"At the Gala!"
 
[m] The look she was giving him was one Blueblood knew all too well. Infatuation.
 
"I will find him, my prince charming," Rarity sang, slipping closer.
"And how gallant he will be!
And he'll treat me like a lady
To-night at the Gala!"
 
[m] He lowered his head to just barely touch horns with her, his high spirits threatening to slip away.
 
"This is what we've been waiting for,
To have the best night ever.
Each of us will live our dreams
Tonight at the Gala.
At the Gala!"
 
"At the Gala," he whispered.
 
_sc_00007 (gala, early evening,  day 43)
 
[m] As she always did, Twilight ran ahead to meet with the Princess.
 
[m] Celestia herself stood proud and tall at the prominent fork of the Oratory Chamber, greeting the long line of guests
 
[m] He had told Twilight as much, and reminded her to be patient. Every Gala was the same for Celestia.
 
 
[m] Blueblood was starting to realize, finally, why his aunt had invited the Elements of Harmony, knowing they would cause some sort of scene. It wasn't that she hated the Gala, as Blueblood had come to for a time.
[m] She just needed some small, tiny release from the repetition and monotony. More than anyone else alive – if he was alive – Blueblood understood how she had to be feeling, and why her eyes lit up when she saw her prize pupil enter the room.
 
[ra] "Is something wrong?"
 
[m] He blinked, a little thrown to have heard the voice next to him. Of course. He wasn't alone tonight.
 
[ra] "You had a far off look," Rarity observed, appearing worried.
[ra] "Not that I meant to pry."
 
[bb] "No," he replied, giving off a confident air.
[bb] "It's nothing. Please, allow me to introduce you to the Princess?"
 
[ra] "I'd be delighted!"
 
[m] It was just a gesture, really.
[m] Atop the stairs, Twilight and Celestia were already starting to get swamped after exchanging a few words.
 
[bb] "Auntie."
[m]  Blueblood bowed respectfully.
[bb] "A pleasure as always to be in your presence. This is Miss Rarity."
 
[ra] "Princess."
[m] Rarity's bow was as flawless and proper as one would expect.
 
[Cel] "Honestly, you two," Celestia remarked in courteous exasperation.
[Cel] "No need to stand on such formality with me."
 
[bb] "In that case, Auntie, may I ask where Princess Luna has gone to?"
[m] He looked around.
[m] "She should be here... or waiting to come out...?"
 
[Cel]"Oh, that."
[m] The Princess of the Sun sighed sadly.
[Cel] "I do appreciate you trying to convince her to come, Blueblood. But she told me she's simply not ready to make public appearances yet. Such a shame. Tonight would have been a perfect night to have some fun."
 
[bb] "She declined? Again?" He cringed at that last word slipping out.
 
[Cel] "Maybe next year," Celestia mused.
 
[bb] "I see."
[m He motioned for them to continue into the Gala proper.
[bb] "Shall we, Miss Rarity?"
 
[m] Before they left, however, he felt the need to whisper to the waiting magical prodigy:
 
[bb] "Please bear with the formality, Miss Sparkle."
[m] He knew how impatient she was to spend time with the Princess.
[m] "There will be ample time after the opening ceremonies."
 
[m] Leaving the Princess and her student behind, Rarity felt compelled to ask, having heard or guessed at the exchange,
[ra] "The ceremonies are two hours, aren't they?"
 
[bb] "Yes," he replied, unhappy with that fact.
[bb] "I wasn't able to change that. Miss Sparkle will just have to be patient."
 
[ra] "Well," Rarity maintained, keeping upbeat.
[ra] "We do have all night, don't we?"
 
[bb] "We do,"
[m] he answered, with a smirk.
[bb] "Nothing will ruin this night. Now, would my lady enjoy a tour of the Grand Pavilion?"
 
_sc_00008 (gala garden, evening,  day 43)
 
 
[m] The Private Gardens were as wonderful as Fluttershy had imagined.
 
[m] Already, the quiet background murmur of voices was giving way to the chirping and singing of nature's chorus. Trees and bushes, shrubs and ferns, unlike anything she had seen
 
[m] Smiling at the sound of a whistle in response, she skipped ahead –
 
[m] Only to run into a single, stark sign.
 
[PLEASE do not disturb the animals]
 
[m]  her wings flared as she came upon another sign. This one was a bit odd.
 
[Please PLEASE please]
- it pleaded  –
[Do Not Disturb The Animals]
 
[m] (add a joke of animals being separated by line from a cartoony drawing of fs?)
 
[m] There was also a picture of a bear, a monkey, and a bird with a circle and a line through them. Fluttershy was on the verge of saying or doing something unfilly-like, when she caught one last line of writing on the sign:
 
[for safe wildlife encounters, please see a Royal Game Warden]
 
[m] The pretty pegasus mare pursed her lips unhappily.
 
 
[m] The more Fluttershy thought about it, the more sense it made, especially for a night like the Gala when hundreds of ponies would be hanging around, that the staff would want to minimize the impact the party made on the gardens and wildlife.
 
[m] She looked around for a 'Royal Game Warden'...
 
[m] And, coincidentally, found one trimming some bushes! She would have mistaken him for some sort of gardener, what with the beaten up old hat on his head, tool belt, and the fact that he was probably pushing sixty.
[m] She would have – if not for the rather elaborate vest that hung around his torso and front legs.
[m] It was green and white, and seals on the sides vividly proclaimed: "Royal Chief Game Warden."
[m] Fluttershy smiled happily; this had to be just the pony she needed! Soon she'd be on a wildlife adventure, and one that followed the rules, too!
 
[m] The "Royal Chief Game Warden" whistled to himself while he trimmed the hedge-  perfectly mimicking the meadowlark she had heard before.
 
[fs] "Oh, um... excuse me..." she called to the Game Warden.
 
[m] He just kept working, whistling all the while.
 
[fs] "I. Um. If it isn't too much trouble..."
 
[m] He just kept working, switching his shears for a rake.
 
[fs] "Excuse me," she tried again, a bit louder and more assertive.
[m] He turned his head, leaning on his rake for support.
 
[mule] "Yep?" he asked, simple as that.
 
[fs] "I was wondering..." she stammered.
[fs] "You're a royal game warden?"
 
[mule] "The chief of 'em, or so I've heard," the old pony replied.
 
[fs] "I was just hoping... I mean, since the sign said... I'd like to have some wildlife encounters."
[m] She then added, a little more loudly,
[fs] "Please?"
 
[mule] "Wildlife encounters?"
[m] he asked, seemingly confused, and then his eyes opened wide.
[mule] "Oh! You must be that pegasus filly!"
 
[fs] "Um."
[m] Fluttershy ducked low, her pink mane falling over one of her eyes.
[fs] "I am 'a' pegasus filly, you mean?"
 
[mule] "Sure, sure. Wilderness encounters!"
[m] The old coot chuckled, swinging the rake over his shoulder.
[mule] "Stick close now, how about we start with the bird feeders we set up this mornin'?"
 
[m] Bird... feeders?
 
[fs] "Oh."
[m] She hurried to keep up with the Game Warden.
[fs] "That'll be... nice."
 
_sc_00009 (near vip spot but still outside?, evening,  day 44)
 
[m] It didn't take long to find the perfect spot to set up shop.
 
[m] A quick kick, and the food stall unfolded, the sides popping out and a pair of small flags snapping out to wave in the breeze.
 
[m]  Since so much of that wing was reserved for the Wonderbolts and their little VIP get-together, this spot would allow her to catch the eye of most everypony leaving that section for the other two. It was also open air, so there were no obstructions and plenty of space for customers to mill around and eat.
 
[m] The only thing dampening the apple farmer's optimistic mood was what she had for sale.
 
[m] had somehow been talked into actually writing "Be Decadent!" on the front of the cart, superimposed over the original apple and stylized hearts.
 
 
[m] She still had the cider and hard cider bottles, but her main selling point would be – had to be – the revamped pies and tarts.
[m] Opening a sliding tray, she carefully put them on display.
[m] Each one was just a slice of pie, slightly tilted on it's side and decorated with frilly apple curls with the skin on, to give it a saw-like appearance.
[m] Caramel and chocolate made out the outlines of the Princess's cutie marks all over each plate.
 
[m] Momentarily distracted, she didn't notice when a stallion in the distinctive blue and gold of the Wonderbolts wandered over.
 
[Sor] "Hey, hey, what's that?"
[Sor]. "Apple pie? I love apple pie!"
 
[aj] "Hungry, are ya partner?"
[m] Applejack quickly put on her game face, and became all smiles.
 
[Sor] "Sure am!"
[m] The Wonderbolt exclaimed, salivating at the dishes on display.
[Sor] "Hungry as a horse! How much for a slice of pie?"
 
[aj] "...tenbits..."
 
[Sor] "How much was that?"
[m] the boisterous pegasus asked, angling his ear towards her.
 
[aj] "Ten," Applejack said a little more clearly.
[aj] "Ten bits."
 
[Sor] "Ten bits?!"
[m]  the Wonderbolt yelled, and whistled loudly.
[Sor] "Too rich for my blood, even for pie! Looks real pretty, though!"
 
[m] Applejack watched the pegasus trot off, on the verge of yelling for him to come back. She had...she had...
[m] lost
[m] lost a customer.
 
[oc-???] "Excuse me, Miss." A jasmine-yellow colored mare snapped Applejack out of her stunned state.
[m] The mare in front of her had a deep blue mane and an elegant purple and blue dress.
 
[aj] "Yes?"
[m]  Applejack asked, still in a sort of haze.
 
[oc-???] "I'd like to try one of your tarts,"
[m] she said, sounding impatient.
[oc-???] "Ten bits, really?"
 
[aj] "Oh. Oh! Yes. Ten bits,"
[m] Applejack repeated, and handed over one of the platters.
[m] They had to be expensive looking, at least, but they didn't need to be super fine.
[m] Each one was half a bit itself. Honestly,
 
[m] But then, suddenly, ten bits fell in her wooden money jar.
 
[oc-???] "Oh, yes, yes!"
[m] The socialite used a fork to sample some of the repackaged pie.
[oc-???] "Quite delicious,"
[m]  she stated with authority.
[oc-???] "Just the right amount of cinnamon! Simply divine."
 
[aj] "Um..."
[m] Still a little shell shocked, Applejack was slow to reply. "Thank you. Thank you very much?"
 
[m] Barely twenty seconds passed, before two ponies took the mare's place, a stallion and his wife... or marefriend.
[m] Both were impeccably well dressed; the stallion even had a top hat.
[m] Applejack could hardly believe it when he ordered two slices, one for himself and one for his date. Ten bits plus ten bits.
 
[aj] "Ah don't believe it,"
[m] she muttered, and stared as more and more customers began to head her way.
 
[m] It wasn't long before the jingle of gold washed away what was left of her hesitation.
 
[m] , but if she sold out tonight... at ten bloody bits a slice... she would end the night with a profit of almost a thousand bits. It boggled the mind.
 
[aj] "Ah just don't believe it."
 
[m] (maybe have it written so that a larger crowd surrounds her cart more and more ?)
 
 
_sc_00010 (VIP, evening,  day 44)
 
 
[Spi] "Always hungry after a show, eh Soarin’?"
 
[Sor] "You know it! I was looking for ya! Let's hit the buffet!"
 
[Spi] "Honestly, you're like a giant parasprite or something..."
 
[Sor] "It's a metabolism thing. Don't blame me 'cause yer jealous..."
 
[m] Soarin’ and Spitfire laughed as they crossed the VIP lounge on their way to the Ménagerie Scorpius and the east wing.
[m] The pair just missed a cyan pegasus in a rainbow colored dress as she approached the two slate-gray security unicorns that checked tickets and IDs.
[m] Acting cool as she trailed behind a Wonderbolt with a white and blue tail and mane, the burly unicorn held up a hoof to stop her.
 
[rd] "Hey guys, chill. Check this out!"
[m] She held up one wing, revealing her VIP pass. [m] "I'm totally in!"
 
[m] The guards primly stepped back, bowing their heads in silent apology.
 
[m] Dash took a few more steps, cool as ice –
 
[m] Before a fangasm struck, throwing her cool demeanor into the punch bowl. By her own count, almost EVERY Wonderbolt was in this one room.
 
[m] Hardly knowing where to begin, she zipped over to the closest table.
 
_sc_00011 (gala dance floor, evening,  day 44)
 
[m] A beautiful, rhythmic canon filled the dance hall of the Ménagerie Ursae.
 
[m] It was a place of reflection and soft spoken conversation; most of the guests weren't quite ready to dance yet, preferring to nibble on hors d'oeuvres and leisurely fraternize.
[m]  The acoustics of the Ursae and the two accompanying salons were fantastic,
[m]  High society ponies sipped champagne and discussed the artwork on display, offering critiques and descriptions of their own collections and personal preferences in style and composition.
 
[m] Pinkamena Diane Pie, that was, entered with the soft sound of her hooves on the dance floor. She did not bounce. Oh but she wanted to! (But she did not.)
[m] The shiny dance floor! (It was quite a nice dance floor.) Oh, and there were so many pretty ponies! (There were many fine individuals present.) And the fancy band! (The Canterlot Chamber Orchestra would be quite fancy, yes.)
 
[m] She reminded herself, literally, that this was not that kind of party.
 
[m] All she had to do was show a little patience and composure. Remember what the books said. Remember what the nice Prince had said. A lady did not just barge in.
 
[m] Fixing her long, straight hair, Pinkamena listened to the music. She knew the type of music. She simply had to apply what she had hastily learned. Parties were her specialty, after all. She could do this, even on such short notice. There was no party which she could not master.
 
[m] Analyzing the musical canon, she picked out the beat. Determined the necessary steps.
 
[m] She would dance to this... as soon as the opportunity arose.
[m] Jumping in would not be conducive to long term dancing and enjoyment. First – Blueblood had insisted – she needed to mingle.
[m] Walking slowly towards a promising pair of stallions, she flashed a small, friendly smile as they noticed her approach. Pinkamena was being a bit bolder than she had been told to be, but it couldn't be helped. Pinkie Pie was naturally impatient.
 
[pp] "The music is quite lovely, isn't it?" she asked.
 
[m] One of the stallions, a large, ochre gentlecolt with a blonde mane the same color as Applejack's, tittered and adjusted his red cravat neckcloth.
[m]  He was a unicorn, but with the sort of large build that Pinkamena had noticed most Canterlot unicorns had. It was different from the ones in Ponyville, like Pokey.
 
[m] His friend was an earth pony with the rather common hourglass cutie mark, and a dark blue coat. His mane was close cut and styled, and a shade of distinctive but not bright orange. He also wore a simple collar and red bowtie.
[m] He smiled at her, and she noticed he had golden eyes.
[m] Pinkamena decided he would be her first target. She would dance with him. She needed a partner for the Marché.
 
[oc-??? 1] "Yes, I heard the Canterlot Chamber Orchestra play at the Reinsworth last year,"
[m] the unicorn replied.
[oc-??? 1] "The cellist is new, but quite good."
 
[oc-??? 2] "Octavia, I believe,"
[m] the earth pony supplied the name.
[oc-??? 2] "But where are my manners?"
[m] He gestured to the unicorn first -
 
[oc-??? 2] "Sun Beam," the noblepony introduced himself.
 
[m] – and then himself  –
 
[oc-??? 2] "Blue Shift," the earth pony said, inclining his head politely.
 
[m] "Pinkamena Diane Pie." She curtsied.
 
[m] Inside her, Pinkie was vibrating enough to very nearly explode. (Just hold on a little longer, would you?)
[m] She wanted to dance. Even if it was slow, kind of boring dancing. She was here to dance. She wanted to dance and party and maybe sing oh and jump on stage and –
 
[m] The music changed to a similar, slow piece. Pinkamena found herself liking this one a bit more than the last. It was a little faster, but it still had a very simple, three step movement to it.
 
[oc-??? 1] "A spell that would allow one to visit Cloudsdale?"
[m] Sun Beam took a drink from his glass and licked his lips as he tried to think of the implications.
[oc-??? 1] "Naturally, you'd need to attach it to an... amulet or charm of some sort. It wouldn't do to have to keep recasting it every six or seven hours or what-have-you."
 
[oc-??? 2] "Ah, but imagine the looks on your friends’ faces when you tell them: I have a summer home in Cloudsdale,"
[m] Blue Shift breezily joked.
[oc-??? 2] "Of course, you must say it straight-faced."
 
[m] They had been talking about the trip Pinkamena shared about the Young Flyer's Completion.
 
[pp] "Blue,"
[m] she used just his first name, catching his immediate attention,
[pp] "would you care to dance?"
 
[m] He paused, and smiled, growing agreeable.
[oc-??? 2] "That would be quite nice, Miss Pinkamena. Sun Beam, hold my drink would you?"
 
[m] The two earth ponies stepped out into the dance floor, their intent obvious.
[m]  A few who had been standing around near the middle of the dance floor noticed and gave room. A few others, mostly high society mares, also took a brief intermission in their gossip to watch.
 
[m] Blue Shift bowed, flowingly, and Pinkamena made sure to do the same.
 
[m] She had to watch him. He was her partner for the dance. The stallion was supposed to take the first step. As she'd expected, he took a step back, and she took a step forward. He stepped to the left, and she to the right. He started off with just basic moves, and soon Pinkamena found she didn't have to watch his hooves. She could tell just from the music and from his upper body.
 
[m] The tempo of the canon picked up, just a little, but Pinkamena knew it was a prelude to things slowing down a little later. Their steps matched, and with a smile, Blue Shift motioned with a hoof and turned on a slant. She quickly did the same, and twirled around, her dress brushing against his legs. She'd picked well! Lucky! Blue Shift was a good dancer!
 
[m] Pinkamena shared a smile with him as the music slowed, easing down to the end of the piece. Perhaps feeling a little emboldened by her ability to keep pace so well, he used a new move, a 'glissade' to the left. He flowed easily, gliding to the side, and she followed. They matched marches for a few more steps, took a 'glissade' to the right, and ended with a flourish – he reached for her hoof, raised it high, and pulled her into a pirouette.
 
[m] They came apart, each taking a step back, and bowed.
 
[m] Pinkie was, for a moment, silent. So was the dance hall. Then, oh so quietly at first, mares and stallions began to clap – gently tapping their hooves on the shiny floor.
[m] Opposite her, Blue Shift was breathing a little heavily, but he was all smiles as he stood back up.
[m] On stage, the band paused a short while, and then began another quiet piece of classical music.
 
[m] Inside, Pinkie was cheering, exultant with triumph and accomplishment. She had done it!
 
[m] Blue Shift retrieved his drink, and he and Sun Beam resumed their conversation.
[m] Pinkamena lingered, joining in as necessary. Mingling. That was a party skill, too. This 'Gala mingling' was just so different from the kind she was used to. The dance-bug was out of her system, at least for a little while, but she wasn't tired yet. Not even close.
 
[m] The high of accomplishing what she herself had wondered if she could do was also beginning to fade. The answer was... clearly more challenging dances.
 
[m] And more ponies. She could see – feel – that there were other ponies here just waiting for the chance to dance, too
 
[m] It was fun, wasn't it? This was why she had come to the Gala. To party.
[m] Yes. Pinkamena had had fun. She was sure of it.
[m]  Pinkie was strangely quiet.
 
_sc_00012 (gala x, evening,  day 44)
 
[m] Blueblood smiled inwardly; not the dignified placeholder grin he wore on the outside, but a big, childish grin.
[m] The sort of grin that says: 'I know what's in this present! This is the one thing I've wanted all year! I know it's in there, and it's all mine! Mine! Mine! Bwa-hahaha!'
[m] That sort of smile.
 
[m] Now he just needed to play the part of the Prince and occasionally teleport away to take care of three or four little Gala disturbances.
[m] All he had to do was remind her that he had some important errand or another to quickly run, or some Gala function to see to, and she was quite willing to wait a minute or two
 
[m] He had, to that end, been a perfect gentlecolt. No tricks. No fun at her expense.
 
[m] It actually wasn't as terrible he used to find it, when he played along on certain Gala loops.
 
[m] They had walked about the Pavilion, and made small talk about fashion and art. She had been wowed by the Equestrian Crown Jewels, and gone on at length about the various grades of cuts and weights.
[m] Not simply a dressmaker, she was accomplished in all manner of setting and arranging and cutting gemstones.
 
_sc_00013 (gala x, evening,  day 44)
 
 
He had tried to throw her off her element a bit by taking her to the Amber Salon –
[m] it was off limits to most ponies because, unlike the Crown Jewels, there was no security there and it was very delicate – on the assumption that she would be much less familiar with a 'jewel' that wasn't really a jewel
 
[m] To his surprise and amusement, she had quickly determined why he had taken her there, and found it amusing as well.
[m] The room was visually breathtaking, and she had used a practiced eye to pick out the many, many shades, some bold and some subtle, that gave the Salon its legendary reputation.
 
[m] She was less well versed in art. It was a subject Blueblood knew by rote. It was a "proper" thing for a Prince or any high court official to be proficient in. It was thus Princely, and something she no doubt expected of him.
[m] As such, he took her on a brief tour of some of the Palace grounds, pointing out the more impressive paintings and murals and tapestries.
 
[m] His favorite was a gift from Griffin Tribes, made of dragon leather. It took some effort not to show her that 'tapestry.'
[m] Celestia had hidden it away in the corner of a trophy room, but hadn't wanted to insult the griffins by getting rid of it entirely.
[m] Instead, he had pointed out a more recent addition: a hoof-stitched rug given to them by the Plains Buffalo. It was somewhat crude, compared to so many other fine pieces, but there was an elegance in its simplicity that he had come to understand over the last year or so of loops.
 
_sc_00014 (gala x outside, evening,  day 44)
 
[m] Finally, they sat under the open sky of the Ménagerie Scorpius.
 
[m] This was both to rest their legs and to point out the night stars... and to be seen. It was important to be seen together.
[m] In fact, that was probably the most important thing. It wasn't long before court mares were whispering jealously amongst each other, and gentlecolts threw the royal pair appraising, approving looks.
[m] Rarity was quiet for this, which he hadn't expected. It was the part he had expected her to enjoy the most.
 
[m] Then again... no. He wasn't that surprised anymore. Making everypony jealous was something he had thought would make her happy; that it would be the high point of her evening. He had built the night around it.
 
[m] In retrospect, he should have known better.
 
[bb] "Is something wrong?" he asked, keeping his voice very low.
[bb] "Don't you want to be seen out here, with me?"
 
[ra]"Oh, it isn't that,"
[m] she assured him, sitting close enough he could feel the fabric of her shawl– against his shoulder.
[ra] "The evening has been simply wonderful. You've been a perfect host."
 
[m] He frowned, but made sure she didn't see it.
[m] It was nothing, then. Nothing was wrong.
[m] The Gala was Perfect.
 
[m] They sat together in comfortable silence for a minute or two, when the sound of hooves on soft grass grew close. Both unicorns glanced to the left, where an amber earth pony could be seen approaching without hesitation.
[m] Who else could it be? The dress was one of a kind. Though it reminded Blueblood of one loop in particular, and a Gala to remember.
 
[aj] "Either o' you two mind if I sit down here?" Applejack asked, standing to his left.
 
[ra] "Oh, dear," Rarity sat up a little straighter.
[ra] "There's no cushion –"
 
[aj] "Don't worry 'bout it, sugarcube,"
[m] It took a moment for Blueblood to realize the cowpony was waiting for him to speak up.
 
[bb] "I don't mind,"
[bb] "Miss Rarity?"
 
[ra] "The company would be just lovely."
 
[aj] "Thank ya kindly."
[m] , though showing manners he found befitting a court lady, nonetheless plopped down on the raw grass as soon as she had permission.
[m]  Her hat was barely balanced behind her head, and she glanced longingly up at the stars.
 
[ra] "If I may,"
[ra] "how did things go with the apple cart?"
 
[aj] "We sold out more than an hour ago," 
[m] Applejack answered, still gazing upward at the star strewn sky. 
[aj] "All gone. Cept for one bottle o' hard cider I kept fer myself."
 
[ra] "Well, that's wonderful!" her unicorn friend enthused. 
[ra] "Congratulations."
 
[aj] "I made over a thousand bits tonight, Rarity." 
[m] Applejack pulled her eyes from the heavens and stared across at her friend, and at Blueblood, too. 
[aj] "A thousand bits. I ain't never made a thousand bits in one night before."
 
[ra] "You don't sound happy about it," 
[m] Rarity observed, and reached across Blueblood to prod the country mare. 
[ra] "Applejack?"
 
[aj] "Ah guess I'm just a little stunned is all. Plus," 
[m] she added, forcing a smile on her face, 
[aj] "Ah don't have anythin' to do now."
 
[m] She looked contemplative, but shook her head, dismissing troublesome thoughts.
 
[aj] "I have'ta thank ya," 
[m] she said, this time to Blueblood specifically. 
[aj] "You were right. We made out like... like bandits tonight." 
[m] Applejack stared down at her hooves. 
[aj] "Be Decadent... it worked."
 
 
_sc_00015 (gala garden, late evening,  day 44) 

[m] The birds weren't as lively as Fluttershy had imagined.
 
[m] Or maybe it was just that they were paying more attention to the birdseed in her hoof than to her. 
[m] First following the Game Warden, whose name she had learned was 'Green Thumb' – 
[m] then venturing out a little on her own, she had found the resident animals of the Grand Garden frustratingly...
[m] Well: shy.

[m] Animals were different. They embraced her without reservation or duplicity or judgment. She could be herself among them. She didn't need to be 'that shy pegasus.' She could just be Fluttershy.
 
[m] These animals, though...
 
[m] She couldn't understand why, but they didn't come to her when she called to them. They fled when she approached them. They didn't sing back. That was the worst part. They didn't sing back, and Fluttershy couldn't understand why.
 
[m] In the end, she had done as the Game Warden asked. 
[m] She had put birdseed in her hoof, and waited for birds to come to her. They were beautiful birds, too. 
[m] She'd seen the meadowlark from before, and it had eaten out of her hoof and then perched on the edge of a ceramic birdbath. 
[m] There was a cardinal with the most vivid red feathers she had ever seen, and not too far away, she could see a rare bald-headed vulture, an animal not native to this part of Equestria at all.
 
[m] It wasn't just exotic animals, either. Fluttershy had seen many common ones, like squirrels and rabbits and hares. Celestia actually had hares, here! Ones much bigger than Angel Bunny. 
[m] And prairie dogs and even a Groundhog, somewhere – Green Thumb had said that one was rarely seen.
[m] She was excited to meet these critters, too, even though she had many of them back home. It didn't explain why these ones were so reluctant to get near her, though.
 
[m] At least she had seen many new friends. Acquaintances. 
[m] Only a few had come close enough to touch. It was all thanks to the Royal Game Warden, Green Thumb. 
[m] He was a funny looking old colt, but he had helped. 
[m] He'd also told her about the rarest of all animals in the Gardens. Legendary creatures, just like Philomena the Phoenix. Fluttershy wasn't sure if she believed in the legendary jackalope, but it made for a good story.
 
[m] By herself, Fluttershy wasn't sure what she would have done.
 
[m] Gently patting one of the large hares that she'd lured close with a stick of celery, Fluttershy made sure not to make any sudden movements. 
[m] She smiled, faintly. This was... what she had wanted, after all. 
[m] Wasn't it? And she had made a pony friend, too, which was... nice. It was nice.
 
[m] It was... nice.
 
[mule] "Missy?"
[m] Green Thumb crouched nearby, watching her with concern.
 
[m] Fluttershy wiped her eyes.
 
[fs] "Sorry. It's nothing..." 
[m] She looked up at the dark night sky. 
[fs] "I think I'd like to see my friends."
 

_sc_00016 (gala x outside, late evening,  day 44) 
 
[m] Everything was going... swimmingly.
[m] Which was to say: to plan.
 
[m] Up to and until Blueblood noticed a pair of Wonderbolts by themselves, and not with a specific third that he had arranged. 
[m] Tensing up – don't tell me I'll have to loop this again to get it right? – he also froze in place.
[m] It was drastic enough that Rarity and Applejack, who had been chatting to his left and right, also stopped to stare.
 
[ra] "Prince Blueblood?"
 
[bb] "Just – just a moment, please." 
[m] He excused himself from the two mares and headed over to the table where the two Wonderbolts were relaxing, after ducking the cameras. As usual. 

[m] It had gotten to the point where, at most any given time, Blueblood knew where the two friends would be. 
[m] They should have been with Rainbow Dash, too. He knew she got along with them. He knew she was happy hanging out with them. The whole BLOODY point of this was for her to be happy hanging out with them!
 
[Sor] "Oh, hey!" Soarin’ saw him coming first, and pointed.
 
[m] Spitfire turned her head, and stared. 
[Spi] "Prince B –"
 
[bb] "Soarin’. Spitfire. Yes, I know your names." 
[m] He glared at a hovering shutterbug, chasing the pony off without a word. 
[bb] "Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she with you?"
 
[Sor] "Who?" Soarin’ 
[m] wondered, scratching his head.
 
[Spi] "Rainbow Dash? Oh, her!" 
[m] Spitfire got it first. She always did. 
[Spi] "You mean the kid who won the Best Young Flyer's –"
 
[bb] "Competition and the one who saved you in Cloudsdale," 
[m] he cut her off. 
[bb] "Exactly. Her. She's also the Element of Loyalty! Where is she?"
 
[m] Soarin’ shrugged, not knowing.
 
[Spi] "I'm sorry, Prince Blueblood," 
[m] Spitfire apologized, but didn't back down, even with his temper rising.
[Spi] "We haven't seen her. We weren't aware we were supposed to see her."
 
[bb] "That's because it was supposed to be a surprise. It was supposed to be spontaneous. You're supposed to run into each other –" 
[m] He groaned and slammed his hoof into his forehead. 
[bb] "Oh. The pies."
 
[Sor] "Pies?" 
[Sor] "You mean apple pies?"
 
[bb] "Yes. Apple. Pies. If she sells them cheap, you meet Rainbow. If they're too expensive, you don't meet Rainbow." 
[m] He hung his head, shaking it slowly in despair. 
[bb] "I... hate... it when this happens. And I can't just force her to meet you, or she'll be rebellious and try and meet with somepony else."
 
[m] The Wonderbolt pair slowly looked from him, to each other, and then back to the distraught Prince.
 
[Spi] "Sir?" Spitfire tried. 
[Spi] "If you want, we could meet her now?"
 
[bb] "It's too late..." 
[m] He met her eyes, and resolved himself, standing proud. 
[bb] "No. Maybe it isn't. Follow me."
 
_sc_00017 (gala x outside, late evening,  day 44) 
 
[aj] "It looks like your date just became our date, sugarcube. Plus two."
 
[ra] "Oh hush! I wonder what's going on?"
 
_sc_00018 (VIP  x edge of barrier, late evening,  day 44) 
 
 
[m] Rainbow Dash wasn't... unhappy.
[m] She wasn't.
 
[m] It didn't feel right to monopolize any of them. It felt wrong, and the more she thought about it, the more uncertain she was.
[m]  A part of her wanted to use the power that came with her VIP pass. A bigger part of her knew she'd feel guilty doing so. It left her between a mountain and a lightning bolt, as the old saying went.

[m] It wasn't that she was unhappy.
 
[m] Rainbow Dash was just... a little conflicted.
 
[m] Sitting alone and nursing her thoughts, not to mention nursing her drink, she almost missed the small group of ponies that entered the exclusive invitation-only lounge. 
[m] Perking up, she left the table and started over to intercept them, her walk becoming a quick trot as Applejack and Rarity moved ahead.
 
[rd] "I haven't seen you guys all night!"
 
[aj] "Boy howdy, I didn't know there were this many ah those Wonderbolt types! You must be in hog heaven!"
 
[ra] "Thank you, Applejack, for that colorful metaphor."
 
[m] Not the least embarrassed, the three mares embraced, laughing and completely at ease together. 
[m] It was only a moment in time, but they all seemed rejuvenated by the brief reunion. Soon, Rainbow Dash was being introduced, for the first time, to Rarity's "escort" for the evening, and the stallion who had done so much to help out for the Gala. Strangely, he seemed a little out of sorts. Dash guessed he just hadn't been expecting them all to meet up like they had. He was also more than a little overshadowed by his company.
 
[rd] "Spitfire! Soarin’! EEEEE!"
 
[Spi] "Yo." The former raised a friendly hoof in greeting.
 
[Sor] "Hey," the latter chimed in.
 
[m] Dash felt Applejack nudge her playfully, throwing a sly wink her way.
[m] Maybe the night was looking up.
 
_sc_00019 (VIP  x edge of barrier (close but elsewhere outside ?), late evening,  day 44) 
 
[m] Blueblood reappeared in a poof of light and smoke.
 
[bb] "Apologies, Miss Rarity." 
[m] He turned around, looking for her. 
[bb] "Miss Rarity?"
 
[ra] "Over here." 
[m] She emerged from around a corner, levitating two cocktails. He relaxed, and carefully took one of the glasses with his own magic.
 
[ra] "Another emergency?" 
 
[bb] "This one couldn't be avoided," he apologized again. 
[bb] "But everything should be on track for another hour and a half."
 
[m] The two walked slowly towards the ball room and the Ménagerie Ursae.
 
_sc_00019 (gala on the way to dance hall, late evening,  day 44) 


[m] Rarity was quiet, fiddling a little with her sweet flavored apéritif. 
[m] She had been since they had left Miss Applejack with Dash and the two Wonderbolts. 
[m] Blueblood was never happy having to teleport off on her, but some things were simply necessary for the Gala to go along perfectly. 
[m] This had to be a Perfect Gala. It had to be. He hoped it wasn't testing her patience. Leaving one's date, even for an emergency, was not gentlecoltly.
 
[m] It would explain why she had become rather quiet.
 
_sc_00020 (dance hall, late evening,  day 44) 


[ra] "Blueblood..." 
[m] she finally said, as they entered the hall.
 
[m] Inside, the party was already in full swing, so to speak, all thanks to a carmine pink dance machine at center stage. 
[m] Whatever Rarity had been about to say ended up on the backburner as she watched her friend Pinkie Pie spiral around an equally energetic blue stallion, her pink and white dress, with candy motif, blurring as she moved from one smooth glissade into a pirouette and into another angled glissade.
 
[m] The tempo of the paired violin concerto fueled the duo as they moved around the dance floor; not the only dancing couple, but undoubtedly the most flamboyant. Blueblood also seemed impressed, by the soft 'hmf!' he gave after observing his would-be student showing up everypony else at their own game. 

[m] Sipping from his glass, the apéritif wetting both the palate and the appetite for more than just an exquisite Gala dinner, he held out his hoof.
 
[bb] "Miss Rarity?" 
[m] he asked, invitingly.
 
[ra] "Oh. As shocking as it is to see Pinkie Pie of all ponies dancing out there..." 
[m] Rarity quickly downed her drink as well, and floated the two glasses over to a nearby table. She took his proffered hoof.
[ra] "It would not do to miss out on all the fun, would it?"
 
[m] Cutting across the dance floor, the Prince and fashionista bowed in the customary beginning of the dance. 
[m] As the violins played, starting the second suite, they began to move, stepping and gliding and flourishing with the music. 
[m] Both ponies were versed in their steps, and soon began to experiment by mixing in a petite pas, then a smooth drifting movement backward, and then including the ever popular pas de cheval.
 
[m] The third suite began with a strong, lively beat and the two unicorns continued, having a comfortable and easy time after learning each other's movements. Hooves slid and trotted across the polished floor, and other bodies moved and spun around them. 
[m] While not quite inclined to the passionate energy of Pinkie and her partner, Rarity found Blueblood a more aggressive dancer than she had expected, and as accomplished as one would expect from a born and bred member of the nobility. This was the finale of the score, combining the bursts of spontaneity earlier into a sustained, vivacious beat. They circled, turned, circled, and spun as the final suite drew to a close.
 
[m] The piece ended to the appreciative applause of the growing crowd of dancers.
 
[m] The violinists bowed and rested, as a dark maned mare stood, balanced against her cello. She cleared her throat, bowed deeply, and resumed her place, at the center of the stage. 
[m] Nearly dwarfed by her chosen instrument, she reached up to the strings, and began to play. A rich sound filled the Ménagerie as she performed, the soulful notes of her cello transitioning from introductory prelude to lively allemande.
 
[m] This, too, was a partnered dance form, but it relied less on movement and more on holding one's partner upright and spinning them, or turning with them, in time. It was a matter of trust, as two ponies dancing allemande could stumble and fall together if a major mistake was made.
 
[m] Rarity lost sight of Pinkie as Blueblood lifted her front legs up, but in the absence of any commotion, assumed that her strangely skilled friend had adapted to this dance as well. 
[m] Leaning close to her escort, now, she smiled as he strutted her around, spun her in place, and held her up. The third movement in the cello piece was slower, and she could afford to rest a bit and lean into him.
 
[ra] "You know..." she whispered.
 
[bb] "Yes?" he asked quietly, having heard her.
 
[ra] "This is everything I ever dreamed of." 
[m] She buried her face into his neck. 
[ra] "Thank you for this evening."
 
[m] Her words were kind, flattering even, but there was something in the way she said them –
 
_sc_00021 (gala dinner hall, late evening,  day 44) 
 
[m] They had made it to dinner!

 
[m] The six mares that made up the Elements of Harmony soon collected together, sitting next to one another and talking animatedly. 
[m] The evening was going splendidly. While not as acoustically pleasing as the Ursae, the actual tables were stretched across the equally large Ménagerie Scorpius. 

[m] Closed briefly so the servants could hustle in and remove the buffet and set up the tables and silverware, it was also well suited because it kept all the smells of food to just one hall instead of three.
 
[m] Celestia herself sat at the head of the table, the very apex of the proverbial pyramid, and all ponies radiated from her like the dwindling rays of the setting sun. 
[m] High ministers and office holders were seated the closest to their sovereign; 
[m] Blueblood himself sat to her left, and an empty chair remained unused to her right, reserved for the other Princess of the Realm, in absentia. That open space had not been in the plans until this morning when he had thought to add it, breaking the traditional seating arrangement. Barring his own time loops, Blueblood was confident that Princess Luna would be occupying it next year.
 
 
[m] The Elements of Harmony, all six of them, were to his left in turn: a prominent place within the unspoken pecking order of Canterlot high society. 
[m] Stealing more than a few looks their way, he felt confident that they were all enjoying themselves. 
[m] The timid pegasus had been a bit down after her return, but it was far better than her demanding love from idiotic, obstinate animals and causing a stampede of panicked aristocrats. Back in the company of her friends, she had cheered up and now positively glowed. 
[m] Miss Pinkamena's hair was also starting to curl.
 
[Cel] "Nephew," Celestia spoke quietly, her voice as regal as ever, but her words intended only for him.
 
[bb] "Auntie?" he asked, also keeping his voice down. 
[m] One eye took a quick look at the time.
 
[Cel] "I must commend you," 
[m] she said, dabbing her mouth with a silk napkin. 
[Cel] "You've put quite a lot of work into keep tonight's Gala on schedule."
 
[bb] "The Gala," he cordially reminded her, 
[bb] "is a celebration of the founding of Canterlot, and of you, Auntie. You are the light of Equestria without which there would be only darkness. Why shouldn't it be perfect?"
 
[m] She smiled, knowingly, like he was just a foal. 
[Cel] "Nephew, please."
 
[bb] "Auntie," 
[bb] "Did you want tonight's Gala to be something other than it is?"
 
[m] Her serene expression never wavered.
 
[Cel] "You've become a bit more clever recently," 
[Cel] "And much better at teleportation."
 
[bb] "I've had a lot of time," 
[bb] "Auntie..."
 
[Cel] "Your Gala is perfect, Blueblood. You've done a remarkable job. I mean that, I really do." 
[m] She looked out over the guests, and the quiet background music, and the orderly attendants, and the finery on display. 
[m] One mauve eye crinkled a little, and for a heartbeat, she looked old and... sad.
 
[bb] "Auntie," 
[m] he asked, a hint of desperation in his voice. 
[bb] "Should I not have done this?"
 
[m] She kept her eyes on the Gala, as if deciding the answer for herself.
 
[bb] "The fun in life is not knowing what's going to happen," 
[bb] "The wisest of ponies relish a little nonsense now and then. You told me that."
 
[m] Her one visible eye traced over to him. 
[Cel] "I never told you that, nephew."
 
[m] He bowed his head, quickly, respectfully.
 
[Cel] "Maybe it was foalish of me, anyway," she whispered. 
[Cel] "I..."
 
[bb] "Pardon," 
[m] Blueblood interrupted her, reluctantly.
 
[m] And teleported.
 
[m] A second before he did, a pony stood up at the far end of one of the tables, distant enough that his face could hardly be seen with any detail. 
[m] The stallion clutched at his throat, coughing and choking. His chair fell to the floor, and he stumbled back – into a waiting body. 
[m] Front legs reached up and around, locking in place and then thrusting back. With one smooth movement, whatever was in the guest's throat flew across the table to land in a bowl of fruits.
 
[m] The danger past, Blueblood held the older stallion back into his seat, and teleported back to his own chair. There was some scattered applause, as various ponies realized what had happened, but for the most part there was only stunned silence.
[m] Not looking terribly pleased with himself, the Prince stood at Celestia's side, asked for the music to resume, and took his seat again.
 
[Cel] "Nephew..." 
[Cel] "We should have a talk. In private."
 
[bb] "Miss Sparkle will..."
 
[Cel] "Twilight and her friends will be staying the night here in the castle," 
[Cel] "She will understand if I wish to have a few words with you, of all ponies."
 
[m] He bowed; there was no point arguing.
 
[bb] "As you wish, Auntie."
 
 
_sc_00022 (castle – somewhere with balcony and overview on the town , late evening,  day 44) 
 
 
[m] There was no hiding things from Celestia. 
[m] She asked, and he answered, and told her everything.
 
[m] Justifiably, even for an immortal goddess, it took a few seconds to settle in.
 
[Cel] "How many... times has this happened?" she gently asked. 
[m] The two were alone on a balcony in the Royal Apartments, overlooking the golden crowns of Canterlot's towers below. 
[m] A cool night air sent a ripple through Celestia's ethereal mane, the coruscating aurora of colors shifting in place.
 
[bb] "I'm not even sure anymore,"
[m]  he answered, looking out over the Palace. 
[bb] "I lost count a long time ago. Hundreds. Maybe a thousand or more?"
 
[m] He heard her wings unfurl, and one settled softly on his back.
 
[Cel] "My poor boy."
 
[m] He tore his eyes from Canterlot and saw that she was looking at him with worry. 
[bb] "You believe me then? Or do you think –" 
[m] he tapped his head, 
[bb] “– the problem is in here, and not in here." 
[m] He tapped his chest.
 
[Cel] "I believe you. For what's left of tonight, I'll believe you." 
[m] She reached out and lowered his hoof. 
[Cel] "You're not the stallion you were yesterday."
 
[bb] "I wonder if you'd say that, knowing some of the things I did when I learned about this condition. I did..."
[m]  He frowned in remembrance and hung his head in shame. 
[bb] "I did desperate, terrible things. And I did things to spite you, Auntie."
 
[Cel] "In your position... I probably would have done the same, eventually," 
[m] she remarked with a casual chuckle; so reversed was she, there were many who would doubt that fact, even in light of her saying it herself. 
[Cel] "Blueblood, I am as much a pony as anypony else. We all have our flaws and vices, our conflict between what we want to do and what we must do. In the past, you've been..."
 
[bb] "A disappointment," 
[bb] "I know," 
[m] he admitted, looking away. 
[bb] "I've seen... learned... about how many mistakes I made. I know how little I used to even care."
 
[m] Celestia shifted a little next to him.
 
[Cel] "I wish I could help you. But there is no magic I know of that can deal with a problem like this."
 
[bb] "I know," 
[m] he replied, wanly at first but then with genuine amusement. 
[bb] "Believe me, I know. I've asked you so many times. Searched everywhere. Nothing."
 
[Cel] "Is that why you did what you did tonight with the Gala?" 
 
[bb] "Partly." 
[m] He nodded, confirming her suspicion. 
[bb] "A part of me thought: maybe if the Gala goes perfectly, then the loop will end? There has to be a reason why this is happening to me, on this night of all nights. And partly, it was just out of curiosity. Could I even do it?" 
[m] Blueblood chuckled again, easily. 
[bb] "I think I've gotten to the point where I'm doing things just for the challenge of doing them."
 
[m] The cloudless sky – cleared for the Gala, perfectly! – stretched overhead as the royals sat in silence.
 
[Cel] "You may have spoiled my fun tonight. A little," 
[m] Celestia admitted, and ruffled his mane, causing the grown stallion to roll his eyes and grumble. 
[Cel]"But I was proud of you, tonight, too. My little pony."
 
_sc_00023 (castle – font of bedchamber , midnight-ish,  day 44) 
 
 [m] The night was over.
 [m] The Perfect Gala night.
 
[m] Blueblood held his head high as he walked to his quarters. 
 
[m] Having just unbound his bowtie, he came up short as he noticed somepony besides his two usual retainers waiting for him by his suite door. It was her. What was she doing here?
 
[bb] "Miss Rarity," 
[m] he said, bringing the smile back to his face. 
[bb] "Hello."
 
[ra] "Prince Blueblood,"
[m]  she replied, ducking her head in courtesy. 
[ra] "I wanted to thank you again for the wonderful night. For myself and for my friends."
 
[bb] "No need,"
[m] he assured her, dismissing the niceties with a wave of his hoof.
[bb] "It was my pleasure."
 
[ra] "I also..." 
[m] She flushed demurely, her royal blue eyes darting away. 
[ra] "Wanted to talk to you. In private."
 
[bb] "As you wish," 
[m] he deferred, motioning for her to walk alongside. 
[bb] "My study is this way."
 
[m] She still wore her Gala dress, he noticed, but without some of the accoutrements. 
[m] Specifically, most of her jewelry had been left somewhere – probably her room – and its absence drew attention to her features. 

_sc_00024 (study room , midnight-ish,  day 44) 


[m] A bit of magic unlocked his private study, and a flash of light activated the electronic lights. 
[m]  Sadly, this gave the room a harsher form of illumination than it needed
 
[ra] "So this is... your office?" 
[m] Rarity asked, looking around.
 
[bb] "My apologies for the mess, Miss Rarity. And for the lights."
 
[m] His horn glowed, and he turned off some of the bulbs, reducing the brightness by lengthening the shadows. 
[m] It was uneven lighting now, as some places flared while others darkened, but the overall effect was close to desired.
 
[m] It was, he had to admit, a bit of a clutter. Never the most organized or efficient or diligent pony, every morning he found his study in the same state of disarray, like a constant reminder of how neglectful and wasteful he had been 'yesterday.' 
[m] He tidied up much of it by rote each day, now, as he saw to the Office of the Veneur's internal audit.

 
[ra] "Is it very much work?" 
opening a nearby window to let air in. 
[m] Her hoof brushed against a faint magical field that functioned as a screen outside the window, both to prevent things like insects from getting inside, and to ensure that other things, like thieves, couldn't make off with precious documents.
 
[m] Luna's moon, full and bright, could be seen outside, providing a light of its own.
 
[bb] "If you had asked me that yesterday, Miss Rarity, I would have said no: it isn't much work at all." 
[m] He smiled, running a hoof along one of the hanging maps. 
[bb] "But more recently, I've started to remember why I accepted this job, and the extra work has found more meaning."
 
[ra] "How so?" 
[m] she asked, trotting over to see what he had: it was a map of Everfree.
 
[bb] "It was easy to forget that this office affects the lives of others. Lines on a map, you see?" 
[m] He pointed to a straight border, and a neat, right angle. 
[bb] "I never went out to actually see these places, but there are ponies down there. Like your friend Applejack. She lives here."
 
[m] He pointed to a large, sprawling delineation of land.
 
[ra] "Is this to scale? I never imagined that Sweet Apple Acres was so large. And this is Ponyville here?"
[m]  She pointed to a few neat intersections on the map. There were no buildings shown.
[m]  Just ordinance zones, marked with tiny letters. 
[m] He also noticed that she had taken off those crystal slippers. How any mare could walk in such things, he couldn't imagine.
 
[m] Of course, the map was dominated by Everfree Forest.
 
[ra] "Oh, and here's the mountain with that dragon Fluttershy chased off!" 
[m] Rarity pointed out another area, with high peaks stylized in two dimensions. 
[ra] "This little rectangle here must be the ruined castle? Is Zecora's hut on here anywhere?"
 
[bb] "The zebra of Everfree?" 
[m] he asked, having heard the name before. He had even tracked her down once, hoping her 'zebra voodoo' had some cure for his condition. 
[ra] "Not yet. I should probably add it sometime, but I believe... here?" 
[m] He took a quill and marked a spot in the forest with a small 'x'.
 
[m] They tittered a little, and he showed her a few other maps, this time of exotic places. Ponies only lived and settled in a relatively small percentage of Equestria. 
[m] Most of it was empty or considered uninhabitable. Sections had to be cleared and prepared for settlement: the wildlife tamed or domesticated or otherwise made harmless. 
[m] Diseases had to be magically eradicated and weather had to be bridled by teams of trained pegasi.
 
[m] Blueblood found himself enjoying having a guest here, in a place he considered more private than even his bedchamber. 
[m] Royal ponies had charted far off lands, and copies of almost every place known to ponykind existed here or in the formal office headquarters. Most of it had been collecting dust for years.
 
[ra] "What about this?" 
[bb] Rarity gestured to a newer, rougher map.
 
[bb] "That is actually a maze," 
[bb] "The laurel maze outside in the gardens."
 
[m]  Octagonal, it was without peer in all of Equestria, and the centerpiece of the larger Grand Garden complex. 
[m] Blueblood highlighted some of the more interesting features: the statuary at the south entrance, for example, featuring a number of unknown, ancient works in one area, and newer façades to the east and west. There were areas within the maze as well, for tents and smaller pavilions. These were arranged in symbolic geometric shapes and along cardinal points.
 
[ra] "You'll forgive me, but it sounds as if your true calling is in maze making," 
[m] Rarity observed, having endured his long-winded exposition.
 
[bb] "That isn't inaccurate." 
[m] He gazed fondly at the map.
[bb] "I have my cutie mark because of the laurel maze outside. It is... special to me."
 
[ra] "Would you mind if I asked about it?" 
[m] Polite and ladylike as always.
 
[bb] "There isn't much to tell. Actually, you're the second filly today to ask about my cutie mark." 
[m] He traced a line along the south end of the maze. 
[bb] "When I was young, I snuck away from my lessons to play in the gardens here. I was foalish and loved to poke my nose where it didn't belong. You probably know how little colts and fillies can be."
 
[m] Rarity shook her head in dismay.
[ra] "You could say that."
 
[bb] "Well, I wandered into the maze, thinking there was candy or some other silly thing in the middle. Something Auntie Celestia and the other adults wanted to hide or keep for themselves. Why else would someone make a big maze? I wandered around with a pen and paper and tried to find the center. When I noticed ponies looking for me, I hid, because I didn't want to get in trouble.
 
[bb] "Of course," 
[bb] "I got in trouble."
 
[ra] "Of course." 
[m] Rarity seemed to be enjoying the story. He continued:
 
[bb] "Eventually, I found the center of the maze. Mostly through blind luck." 
[m] He pointed with the back of his feathered quill to a small space in the absolute center of the hexagon, sandwiched between three larger open pavilions. 
[bb] "But there wasn't any candy or any prize. I didn't turn into an alicorn or find a pile of bits.
 
[bb] "But..." 
[m] He smirked. 
[bb] "I did get my cutie mark."
 
[ra] "Well?" 
[m] Rarity asked, expecting one more bit of information. 
[rap "You must tell me, Blueblood. What was at the center of the maze?"
 
[bb] "Ah. The center of the maze." 
[m] He hesitated, unable to resist jerking her around a little.
[m] Tapping his chin, he wondered aloud,
[bb] "What was at the center of the maze again? I forget."
 
[ra] "Tease!" 
[m] She tapped his front leg, and blushed hotly at the familiar, forward contact.
 
[bb]"Miss Rarity."
[m] It was his turn to ask something now: 
[bb] "What was it you wanted to talk to me about?"
 
[m] She looked away, shyly. 
[ra] "The Gala."
  
[ra] "Was something wrong with it?" 
[m] he asked. At least he could do better next time.
 
[ra] "I had a wonderful evening. All my friends had a wonderful evening,"
[m]  Rarity told him, looking up into his eyes. 
[ra] "But I don't think you did."
 
[bb] "Me?"
[m]  He blinked a few times, not having expected that at all. 
[bb] "I... didn't?"
 
[ra] "You seemed to know what each of us wanted to get out of the Gala," 
[ra] "You knew that Applejack wanted to make money by selling food here. You knew that Twilight wanted to spend the evening talking with the Princess. You knew that Rainbow wanted to meet with the Wonderbolts; you even knew she'd become friends with Spitfire and Soarin’. Heavens, she couldn't stop talking about them!"
 
[m] He backed away a step, feeling like her analysis of the evening was an accusation.
 
[ra] "You knew that Pinkie wanted to dance and party; she told us all about how you gave her those books and how you showed her how to Marché and slow dance." 
[m] Rarity didn't sound angry, but she took a step forward as he had taken a step back. 
[ra] "You even knew about Fluttershy. The Game Warden she met... you told him to be there, didn't you? He was expecting her."
 
[m] His flank bumped into a desk; there was nowhere left to back up to.
 
[ra] "And of course you knew about me," 
[m] she hammered home, sounding more confused than upset. 
[ra] "I don't know how, but you knew about me. I won't ask what you had to do to learn all those things. I know what you've been doing when you teleported away to 'take care of official functions.' I asked around. Keeping a statue from falling? Saving somepony from choking? Even stopping a servant from dropping a tray of drinks?"
 
[m] She pressed a hoof to his chest.
 
[ra] "Blueblood. I don't know if you used some sort of magic to do it. And I'm not angry." 
[m] He relaxed a bit, and the fashionista lowered her hoof to the floor. 
[ra] "The only pony you didn't seem to bother with was yourself. What did you want out of tonight's Gala?
 
[ra] "I know..." 
[m] she concluded, a little sadly. 
[ra] "I know it isn't romance. I know it isn't me."
 
[m] Yesterday, he would've snorted at her admission. At her broken heart. Today, he felt terrible; he felt like he'd failed. Not just in making the perfect Gala. But as him.
 
[bb] "Miss Rarity..." 
[m] He took her hoof and touched his forehead to hers. 
[bb] "I am sorry. You are a perfect lady. But... I am not a perfect Prince."
 
[ra] "Next year," 
[m] she asked, and he felt her breath on his chest as she leaned into him.
[ra] "Next Gala, I'd like it if we could do what you want. What makes you happy."
 
[bb] "You don't mean that..." 
[m] he tried to protest.
 
[ra] "I do,"
[m] she said, firmly, meeting his eyes.
[ra] "I'll never forget tonight."
 
[ra] "...I wish it could last forever."
