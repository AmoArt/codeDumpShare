[m] (add scene from the donut joe place panning backwards towards the bedchambers windows?)

 

[m] bb dragged himself to bed

[_bb] "Truly, the worst night ever."

[m]  Collapsing face first into the pillows, his body shook with a resounding sigh.

 

_sc_00002 (bedchamber, early morning, day 1)

 

[m] song (Sapphire Shores?)

Blueblood found himself on

staring up at the delicately tiled ceiling.

glance outside at the lush palace gardens and then to ring a bell

 

_sc_00003 (bed prep room, morning, day 1)

 

[m] pair of unicorn mares quickly arrived to groom away the night's frustrations and prepare him for the supposedly casual meeting he had with his Aunts.

Blueblood closed his eyes,

 

 

[m]  Blueblood mentally prepared to meet with the Royal Bouteiller, as soon after breakfast as possible.

[m] Dismissing the two groomers with a haughty wave

[m] bb glanced for a moment at the nearby full-body mirror.

 

_sc_00004 (bed walking closet, morning, day 1)

 

[m] Opening the walk-in dressing closet, he saw his shortened dinner jacket and blue bow tie,

[m] hanging waiting for him, pressed and prepared.

[m] he had many dinner jackets, but this specifically for the Gala.

[m] Last night's Gala.

 

[bb] "Idiots,"

[m]  pushing aside the formal wear for a pale silk collar.

[bb]  "I am surrounded by foals and idiots."

 

_sc_00005 (dining hall, morning, day 1)

 

[m] The living quarters of the Palace opened up to him, but the Guard only became noticeable

[m]  as he approached the pantry and dining hall.

[m] Now those guests were humiliated and no doubt silently enraged at the farce the night had become.

 

[m] Lost in his thoughts, paying little heed to his surroundings, Blueblood sat before the table hosted by his exalted Princess-aunt.

[m]  In fact, both of his great aunts were in attendance, a somewhat rare occurrence.

 

[m] The Princess of the Sun sat at the head of the table, cheerfully and contentedly munching on low class oats and apples.

[m] Luna had finished eating what was actually and effectively her dinner, and remained quietly lost in introspection.

[m] She often partook of a glass of wine before going to sleep for the day,

 

[m] bb placed an order for tea, with milk and ginger, and freshly imported yucca.

 

 

[m] he pondered

[m] She looked so irrepressibly yet silently smug about something this morning,

 

[oc_pp] "Prince Blueblood,"

 

 

[bb] "Proper Place,"

 

[oc_pp] "I trust you are looking forward to this Evening's Gala?"

[oc_pp]  "I have heard you hired from the Canterlot Chamber Orchestra company? I look forward to their rendition of Entry of the Princess in Sun's Light."

 

[m] bb opened his mouth to agree, when he caught what was being said – besides the compliment.

 

[bb] "W-what?" he asked, dumbly, and quickly shook his head.

[bb] "What was that just now?"

 

[oc_pp]  "The Gala, Prince," Proper Place repeated.

[oc_pp]  "I look forward to it."

 

[m] Instantly suspicious of some sort of joke or trick

Bb  glanced back around the room.

It was normal, really, but also gave him the strangest bit of deja vu.

 

[bb] "Of course," wary of some further joke at his expense.

 

[m] He glanced at Celestia

[m] whispering something to Luna,

 

_sc_00006 (balcony with view to gate, night, day 1)

 

 

[m] Night came,

[m] It was the Gala.

 

[bb] "What in the starless Hells...?" muttered silently

[m] he peeked out the window, observing the procession of guests arriving at the castle.

 

[m] (disbelieve)

 

[m] curious impromptu musical number breaking out before the castle gates.

 

 

[m] just like yesterday, when he had expressly cleared the entire day's schedule!

 

[m] Wonderbolts themselves beginning their scheduled performance,

 

 

[oc_?] "Lord Prince!"

[m] The gentle rapping on the door of his study

[oc_?] "Lord Prince! The Princess has inquired as to your presence at the Gala!"

 

[bb] "She – she has?"

[m] rump hit a desk, scattering scrolls and maps onto the floor.

 

[oc_?] "Yes, Lord!"

[oc_?] "Are you well enough to attend?"

 

[bb] "I... yes,"

[bb]  "Yes, I will attend."

 

[m] Pressing an ear up to the study door, he waited for the sound of hoofsteps to die down before opening the door.

[m] (feeling strange)

 

_sc_00007 (random hall + chamber, night, day 1)

 

[m]  descended down to the Royal apartments and summoned his preferred servants.

[m] Quietly, went through the motions of being washed, groomed

[m] fitted into his custom Hoity dinner suit.

 

[m]  one of the nameless chamber fillies presented him with his reflection in a mirror

 

_sc_00008 (gala entrance – prep front , night, day 1)

 

 

[m]  heralds announcing his arrival in the Grand Oratory.

 

[m] The repeat performance, however, filled him with unfamiliar unease and quickly concealed anxiety and confusion.

 

[m] some extras present. One in particular. He ignored her for a moment, (ra)

 

[m] saw Celestia at the intersection of the stairs

[m] Next to the regal Princess was a petite purple unicorn (ts)

 

[m] (large crowd in the hall)

 

[m] Just as he remembered her from yesterday.

[m] (staring at ra as she stare back)

[m] Blueblood screwed his eyes shut, and made a bee-line for Celestia.

 

_sc_00009  (gala entrance - main, night, day 1)

 

 

[Ce] "Ah, Prince Blueblood!" with a warm, welcoming smile.

 

[Ce] "I'm happy to see you could make it. I was a bit worried when I heard you'd been in your study all day."

 

[bb] "Yes, well," he stammered slightly, trying to think up an excuse.

[bb] "There were matters that needed immediate attention."

[m] He quickly bowed his head in a public show of respect and deference.

[bb] "Princess."

[m] Celestia's smile was gracious, and as usual, she tried to skip through the formality.

 

[Ce] "This is my student, Twilight Sparkle."

[m] A little tentatively, Twilight extended her hoof.

 

[bb] "Charmed,"

[m] taking her hoof and favoring the filly with a suave grin. His body and mouth were mostly working on automatic at this point. He needed to pull his Aunt aside!

[bb] "I've heard so very much about you, Miss Sparkle."

 

[ts] "Um. Likewise?" She clearly phrased it as a question.

 

[bb] "Princess."

[bb]  "I have a bit of a problem I'd like to speak with you about..."

[m] he then added, leadingly,

[bb] "in private?"

 

[Ce] "Nephew." hinting at reproachful.

[Ce] "Whatever it is, surely it can wait until later, after all the guests have arrived. Tonight is a very special night; let's not ruin it with work. Just mingle a little and enjoy yourself."

 

[bb] "But..." He tried to inject a little pleading into his voice.

 

[Ce] "Later. I promise." Celestia put her hoof down, and he became silent

[Ce]  "Go. Have fun."

 

[bb] "Of course,"

[m] he acquiesced immediately, lowering his head.

[bb] "Perhaps later."

 

[m] Glancing over his shoulder, he saw that insufferable unicorn watching him.

[m] Her eyes were intelligent and calculating, now, and not quite so blinded by awe and infatuation as before.

[m] bb gave one last farewell to the Princess' little apprentice and retreated to the Ménagerie.

 

_sc_00010  (gala inside, night, day 1)

 

[m] There was something truly strange going on. This meant that it was best to observe, for the moment, so as to formulate a proper response.

 

 

[m] Each of the main chambers was named for a prominent constellation, the very same one that adorned the ceiling of each hall in the form of a great mural.

[m] Facing North was the Bear, East the Scorpion, and West the Hound. Within each individual Ménagerie, the walls were decked in the finest tapestries and frescoes, the most elegant of marble statues were on display, and stained-glass windows provided a rich ambiance.

 

[m] bb mingled in the loosest sense of the word. Autopilot.

[m] He hardly spared a thought -  exchanged empty greetings and idle chitchat with.

[m] He was looking for anything particularly strange.

 

_sc_00011 (gala dance floor, night, day 1)

 

[m] In the Northern Ménagerie Ursae, one of the guests seemed to be causing a scene up on stage.

[m] The perpetrator was a neon-pink mare whose legs seemed to have been replaced with springs.

 

_sc_00012 (gala outside gardens, night, day 1)

 

[m] moved on to check on the Eastern Ménagerie Scorpius.

[m] grand banquet was alluring,

 

[m]The eastern quarter of the Gala, like the west, was partly open air and bordered the most public section of the gardens.

[m] The view of the night sky was particularly striking here, and sections of the colonnade had been prepared to allow guests to sit on the grass and relax while they ate.

 

_sc_00013 (gala outside AJ booth, night, day 1)

 

[m]  noticed that peculiar food vendor he had visited yesterday.

[m] (general annoyance at homely foods)

 

_sc_00014  (gala vip, night, day 1)

 

[m] he elected to investigate the Western Ménagerie Canis. This area was quite popular, as it included the VIP Wonderbolts section

[m] That puddle on the floor was still present as well.

 

_sc_00015  (gala dance hall, night, day 1)

 

[m] It was soon after all this that the commotion began.  shout, a crash from the Ménagerie Ursae,

[m]  mad rush of critters of all shapes and sizes.

[m] A frightened buzzard swooped low, forcing bb to throw himself to the floor

[m] (the usual chaos)

[m]  Once again, Auntie had disappeared.

 

_sc_00016 (gala dance hall - after, night, day 1)

 

[m] he dusted himself off,

[m] watching the surroundings with a strange calm, a certain detachment.

[m] The surprise was gone.

[m] Yet... he wasn't resigned, either. He was curious, confused, perplexed.

 

[m] In a apathetic daze, he quietly retired to his room in the Royal Apartments.

 

_sc_00017 (bedchambers, early morning, day 2)

 

 

[m] (song)

 

[m] reached for the gilded gold and silver radio, fumbling for a moment, before turning it off.

[m] eyes opened, wearily. - inhaled, exhaled, and sat up in bed.

 

[m] Sliding out of bed, he took a moment to look outside. The Grand Gardens stretched out below, and he could see the old groundskeeper already up and working

[m]  It was a beautiful morning,

 

_sc_00018 (bed prep room, early morning, day 2)

 

[m] Ringing the same bell to summon the same servants, Blueblood began his morning routine.

 

[bb] "The Gala is tonight." He stated it with a sigh.

[bb] "Isn't it?"

 

[m] The two mares exchanged surprised and unsure looks.

[m] a light blue filly with soft red mane.

 

[oc_sg1] "Yes, my Prince," she hesitantly replied.

 

[bb] "How nice." He said it without emotion,

[m] and held up his right hoof.

[bb] "Continue."

 

_sc_00019 (dinning hall, morning, day 2)

 

[m]  he entered the dining hall, and saw everyone just where they were before. Eating the same things as before. Chatting about the same things as before.

 

[m] He blinked, hard, and felt a rush of relief as he realized: Celestia was here. Now. He would ask her now! Well. Not quite now.

 

[m] A servant came by, and he placed an order for tea, with milk and ginger.  A dish of freshly imported yucca.

 

[oc_pp) "Prince Blueblood," a cultured voice spoke up. Just like before.

 

[bb] "Proper Place,"

 

[oc_pp] "I trust you are looking forward to this Evening's Gala? I have heard you hired from the Canterlot Chamber Orchestra company? I look forward to their rendition of Entry of the Princess in Sun's Light."

 

[bb] "It should be quite fitting,"

[bb] "Once the Princess shows up, and if nothing goes wrong before that."

 

[m] Strangely, Princess Celestia choose that moment to cover a small smile with a sip of tea, one of her ears twitching.

[m] Naturally, he said not a word of it.

 

[m] This time he really listened. Of particular note was what Celestia and Luna were whispering about... though it was mostly the former whispering and the latter listening. Eventually, Luna finished her drink, and her dinner, and excused herself to rest for the day.

 

[bb] "Auntie,"

[bb] "I would like to have a moment of your time, if I may?"

 

[Ce] "Of course, nephew. What seems to be the matter?"

 

[bb] "I would rather discuss it in private, if I may."

 

[Ce] "You may,"

 

_sc_00020  (private chamber, morning, day 2)

 

 

[Ce] "So, if I understand you correctly,"

[m] Celestia said, craning her neck in bemusement.

[Ce]  "You are repeating the same day, starting from when you wake up?"

 

[bb] "Yes," Blueblood replied, blushing a little at how silly his story sounded.

 

[m] Fortunately, it was just the two of them, alone in her sitting room.

[m] It was among the most elegant of apartments in the Palace, as befitting the Princess of the Sun.

[m] The entire room seemed to give off a soft, gentle glow.

[m] preference had been for a simple, dignified, yet majestic aesthetic.

 

[Ce] "And ending after you go to sleep after the Gala?"

[bb] "Yes."

[Ce] The regal alicorn raised a wing to briefly cover her smile.

[bb] "And no one realizes this except for you?"

[bb] "Again,"

[bb]  "yes."

 

[m] Celestia gave a thoughtful hmm sound as she pondered his words and his situation.

 

[Ce] "I must say, my sweet little nephew..."

[m] She gave him a serious look.

[Ce] "I just don't see where this joke is headed."

 

[m] Blueblood's face fell and he nearly collapsed forward into his hooves.

 

[bb] "This is no prank!" He actually raised his voice. Just a little.

[bb]  "Auntie, please." He lowered his head, all but groveling.

[bb] "I'm not playing a joke. I'm being serious."

 

[Ce] "Nephew," Celestia began, and gently lifted his eyes with her hoof under his chin.

[Ce] "You're clearly distraught, but no magic on Equestria could have the effect you describe. Even Discord himself couldn't cast such a spell."

[m] Her eyes narrowed for a fraction of a second.

[Ce] "Probably."

 

[bb] "The Gala will be a disaster!" he vowed, looking up at her and willing her to believe him.

 

[Ce] "Really?"

 

[bb] "Oh yes," he warned.

[bb] "Cakes will fly and animals will run rampant! You'll disappear and... and..."

 

[m] He deflated.

 

[bb] "And it'll all just be ruined,"

 

[m]– didn't seem to care.

[m] bb hung his head in defeat.

 

[bb] "And you probably already knew that," he realized.

 

[Ce] "You give me too much credit," the Princess of the Sun cooed gleefully.

[Ce] "The fun in life is not knowing what's going to happen. The wisest of ponies relish a little nonsense now and then."

[m] Still, her good mood did falter a bit.

[Ce] "But I'm surprised. How did you know...?"

 

[bb] "I've seen it happen," he answered with a frown.

[bb] "Twice."

 

[m] For a few seconds,– sat in silence.

 

[Ce] "Nephew,"

[m] Celesia finally said, placing a compassionate hoof on his shoulder.

[Ce]  "You are free to search the Royal Libraries for an answer, but I think the problem isn't with magic. The problem,"

[m] she tapped his chest,

[Ce] "is in here."

 

[Ce] "Or maybe here,"

[m] she added, gently rapping her hoof against his forehead.

[Ce] "Perhaps you should see a specialist?"

 

[m] For the second time, Blueblood's spirits sunk, and this time they took his face with them as it planted into the cushions on the floor.

[bb] "Auntie!"

 

 

_sc_00021 (royal physicist, afternoon, day 2)

 

[oc_wb] physician and apothecary, Willow Bark, Unicorns. She had a remarkable penchant for all forms of medicine, traditional, holistic, and magical.

 

[m] watched her back as she stared as a series of arcane sigils that had materialized on sheets of paper. This sort of magic, he didn't understand himself. He just hoped that whatever Willow saw, it was something useful, good or bad.

 

[oc_wb] "I see," muttered,

[m] her hoof rubbing absently against the pocket of her lab coat.

[oc_wb] "I see..."

 

[bb] "Well?" snapped, growing impatient just sitting on place within the circle of runes and salt.

[bb] "What do you see? What's wrong with me? Is it parasites? OH GODS IT'S PARASITES! They're in my brain, aren't they?!"

 

[oc_wb] "No. No. Not parasites,"

[m] finally turning around to look him in the eye.

[oc_wb] "Nor is it lesions, contusions, concussions or infractions. You are in perfect health, Prince Blueblood."

 

[bb] "Then what did you see, you see?" he repeated, impatience making him rude. Ruder. Or at least snarkier.

 

[oc_wb] "I see that you have not had your wisdom teeth removed!" Willow exclaimed.

[oc_wb] "May I schedule you for next week? Next month?"

 

[bb] "NO!"

 

 

_sc_00022 (wiz physicist, evening , day 2)

 

 

[oc_doc2] "Are you sure a zebra hasn't cursed you?"

 

[bb] "Quite certain one hasn't," Blueblood answered, left eye twitching.

 

[oc_doc2] "Well, sir, I can't detect even a hint of magic on you, harmful or otherwise."

 

[m] bb currently sat, wet and miserable, in a tub of magic-suppressing water, with an enchanted blinder and cap preventing use of his horn.

[m] He was personally de-enchanted in every way possible.

[m] A beeping machine of strange earth pony construction whirred and hissed and vomited out a ream of paper covered with scratched lines.

 

[bb] "I want you to be sure!" demand

 

[m] doc2 underling just quirked an eyebrow.

 

[oc_doc2] "We've done all we can to make you magically neutral, sir."

 

[bb] "I'm not moving a damn inch."

 

[oc_doc2] "Um. But... sir... what about the Gala?"

 

[bb] "The Gala can go straight to –"

[m] (add ‘to Tartarus’ ?)

 

 

_sc_00023 (bedchamber, early morning, day 3)

 

[m] (song)

 

[m] (click)

 

[m] bb forced himself out of bed with a long, slow sigh.

 

_sc_00024 (bed prep room, early morning, day 3)

 

[m] The chime of the bell to summon his servants

[m] sunk a pit into the Prince's royal stomach.

[m] The pair met him in the antechamber, and just like before, they helped him get groomed and dressed for the day

 

[m] Eyes open, he watched the two chamber maids for once.

 

[bb] "The Gala is tonight," he asked, directing the question at neither of them in particular.

[bb] "Isn't it?"

 

[m] The two mares exchanged looks.

[m] bb noticed one looked particularly nervous, while the other seemed mostly surprised.

[m] It was the latter filly who eventually replied: the light blue mare with the pinkish-red mane.

 

[oc-2] "Yes, my Prince."

 

[bb] "How very nice," he groaned, and peered more closely at the filly.

[m] Normally he wouldn't have cared, -  but be a little curious.

[bb] "What's your name?"

 

[oc-1] "Light Touch, sir."

[m] She bowed her head respectfully.

 

[bb] "And you?"

[m] he asked the other mare, the unicorn filly with a dark brown coat and straw colored mane.

[m] She lowered her eyes and dipped her head.

[bb] "Speak up already," he commanded.

 

[oc-2] "Excuse her," Light Touch interrupted, trying to still sound deferential.

[oc-2] "She doesn't talk much. Her name's Sandy."

 

[bb] "Wonderful," he deadpanned.

[bb] "Well, may as well get me ready for my big, wonderful Gala Day."

 

 

_sc_00025 (gala entrance/inside, evening, day 3)

 

 

[oc-ano] "Announcing, his Highness, Prince of Equestria and Grand Veneur, Lord Blueblood of the House Blueblood."

 

[m] In fact, after taking note of the musical number at the castle gates, he waited in the Royal Oratory, chatting with two businessponies from Manehattan.

[m] One eye on the clock, he took note of when she entered the room, (Ra)

[m] looking about at the many noble personages with a mixture of nervousness and self-confidence.

[m] She was clearly certain she could fit in if given the chance. She look the part. Like a true lady of the court.

 

[m] Experimentally, he lingered longer than before among the gathered ponies waiting to ascend the stairs and meet Princess Celestia.

[m] The purple pony –was up there, too, hanging by his aunt's side.

[m] (made a not of TS, wondering what she was going to do rest of the day)

 

[m] (Ra was mingling -, but he could see her keeping a discreet eye on him.)

 

[m] Not particularly caring - bb graced her with a small, polished smile.

 

[m] Excusing himself, he headed for the rose bushes.

[m] It would just be a few minutes, and then he'd "catch" her coyly sniffing a rose, and use it to introduce himself. Just like before.

 

_sc_00026 (gala outside rose garden, evening, day 3++)

 

[m] expected, being around Ra didn't make it easier. It made it harder.

 

[m] Despite being his charming self and having quite a little fun at her expense, the mirth of watching her expression fall as he took the rose she had clearly expected him to give her for himself... and then her ruining her dress with that spill... and then making her pay for that carnival food, which he ate just for the fun of following through... on repeat, it was all so stupidly hollow. Two days ago, he had been laughing inside at what he could put her through.

[m] Now it was already stale as rotten millet.

 

[m] (make a sequence of same scene that plays few times differently in a row, bb just messing around and pushing the buttons)

 

[m] The cake hit his face, and Blueblood realized he didn't even care.

[m] (? angry shouting while he is stoic maybe ?)

 

[m] At least this time, the walls didn't come crashing down.

 

[m] Snorting, a bit of apple cake dribbled down his nose to his upper lip.

[m] Instinctively, his tongue darted out to wipe away the frosting and flakes.

[m] It actually wasn't that bad.

 

 

__cut here? Seems like a good point, given the following scenes are pretty long__

 

_sc_00027 (gala vip, evening, day 4)

 

[m] He'd retreated to the Wonderbolt VIP lounge as soon as the Gala started.

[m]  He didn't want to care.

 

[Sor] "Hey, if it isn't the Prince!"

 

[m] Blue eyes lifted from staring at his cup, finding bold gold and blue markings on a coat-tight suit.

 

[m] One was an electric blue stallion with a sloppy dark blue mane, the other an attractive gold-coated mare with amber eyes and a shockingly bright orange mane.

 

[Spi] "Prince Blueblood."

[m] she grace to bow, and elbowed her companion to do the same.

[Spi] "What a surprise to see you here."

 

[bb] "I suppose it is," he replied, injecting a bit of his old self into his flagging spirits.

 

[Spi] "I'm Spitfire." The mare kept her amiable tone.

[Spi] "And this is Soarin’. Are you..." She looked around, but only half-heartedly.

[Spi] "Are you waiting for anyone? If you want, we could get Captain Thunderhead or Raging Storm?"

 

[bb] "That isn't necessary."

 

[Sor] "Hey," spoke up with a familiar grin.

[Sor] "Did ya see the performance? What'd ya think?"

 

[m]  shrugged, the drink half finished and half warm in his gut granting him a comfortable indifference.

 

[bb] "It did the job,"

[bb] "The crowd liked it."

 

[Spi] "Well." seemed a bit surprised by the answer.

[m] She shared a quick look with Soarin’ before turning her eyes back on the Prince.

[Sor] "Did you like it?"

 

[bb] "I said it did its job,"

 

[Spi] "You still haven't answered the question," Spitfire pressed. Boldly, too,

 

[Sor] "What'cha got there?" asked, changing the question and gesturing to the drink.

 

[m] he wasn't even sure what he was drinking, but was willing to just make an answer up –

[m] he noticed a duo of photographers hovering close by. ( pegasi. )

 

[m] (duo) noticed it, too, and had the decency to blush a bit at the unwanted attention.

[m] There was a line of guests just waiting to have their picture taken with the famous - duo.

 

[m] (bb seems bit annoyed at commotion)

 

[m] photographers were wary of interrupting when the two were in the presence of certain royal company.

[m]  Seeing all three staring at them, one of the photographers got a bit bold, and tried to step in.

 

[oc-photo1] "Excuse me,"

[oc-photo1] "If we could just..."

 

[bb] "Leave us," bb  ordered...

[m] suppressing a grin until the two pegasi fled back to find some other Wonderbolts to corral.

 

[m] duo - gave audible sighs of relief, and smiled at him in thanks. It was ironic.

[m] He had hired those photographers, too.

[m] The thought actually dredged a genuine laugh out of the sullen Prince.

 

[Sor] "Thanks,"   said, scratching the back of his mane.

[Sor] "We haven't had a minute to ourselves all night."

 

[bb] "Hm?"

[bb] "You are quite famous."

 

[Spi] "I hate parties like this," Spitfire explained with a grin, suspecting that maybe he did too.

[Spi]  "I mean, yeah, we're famous... but our fans are out there."

[m] She pointed to the gardens.

[Spi] "Not in here."

 

[m]  to realize she wasn't pointing at the gardens, she was pointing past them. Out into the streets of Canterlot and beyond.

[m] He turned his head to gaze out there.

[m] Slowly, he returned to - duo.

 

[Spi] "You want to get out of here?"

[m] Sor - grinned widely.

 

[bb] "...Yes... why not?"

 

 

_sc_00028 (from gala to front of mid-rich pub, evening, day 4)

 

[m] Such a place was beneath him.

[m] took a certain perverse pleasure in going inside anyway. He had heard of such establishments:

[m] "dives" and pubs and gathering places for riffraff.

 

[m] duo - had shed their - uniforms, and he had thrown his Hoity-exclusive dinner jacket into the bushes outside.

[m] No one had dared question any of them. They had just walked out of the party. Just walked out.

 

[m] Blueblood still couldn't quite believe it.

 

[m] Leaving the castle grounds had, at first, filled him with a certain trepidation.

[m] (bb anxiety being outside comfort zone)

[m] It took a little while, but finishing off another drink had calmed his nerves enough to relax more properly.

 

[m] He had all but reared when Spitfire suddenly jumped up and tousled his mane – his precious mane – to better hide his identity.

[m] It was shocking! Scandalous! Improper!

 

[Spi] "Now you're ready to hit the town!" -  had declared, elbowing him playfully.

 

[Sor] "This is the place!"

[m]as they approached the... business.

 

_sc_00029 (front mid-rich pub, evening, day 4)

 

[m] Merchant District. Not the seedy part, mind you – the "new money" rich part of Canterlot.

[m] The bar wasn't even particularly low brow. It was just so un-aristocratic! It catered to rich and middle class working ponies.

 

_sc_00030 (inside mid-rich pub, evening, day 4)

 

[m] Getting inside was actually due to the -duo-, who the two security ponies recognized.

[m] They did not even recognize their beloved Prince. Blueblood wasn't sure whether he was more shocked or disgusted by this. Or even a little thrilled. Anonymity was so... alien...

 

[m] They paid just to have a private booth.

 

[m] After that, he offered to pay for the drinks. He was rich, after all, and it wasn't like it mattered.

[m] They began with a round of the house's most expensive vintage cognac.

 

[m] Soarin’ and Spitfire were full of stories of their years flying together.

[m] (lots of small info, not sure if some of it would make it or be mostly cut?)

 

[m] He thought instead about telling a raunchy story about Princess Celestia. Auntie was the one with the interesting and eternal life. Either that, or he could make something up... change some names around...

 

[m] Before he could, however, he noticed the two Wonderbolts glancing back at the door.

 

[m] A cyan blue pegasus in a Gala dress had somehow managed to talk – or bull – her way inside.

[m]  Her dress – had gotten dirty

 

[Sor] "It's... um...?" clearly remembered this filly, but not her name.

 

[Spi] "Rainbow... Dash, I think?" corrected him with practiced ease.

[Spi] "I guess she followed us?" turned to Blueblood.

[Spi] "Is it alright if...?"

 

[m] He shrugged. Two pegasi or three. It didn't matter.

 

[m] Spitfire got up, and hustled over to greet the rd.

[m] rd seemed relieved to have not made her little trek in vain, and pointing back at their booth, Spitfire seemed to invite her over.

[m] Blueblood couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the look of absolute adulation and fangirl-like pleasure that this new pegasi radiated.

 

[Sor] "Kinda cute, isn't she?" Soarin’ leaned over the booth's table to whisper.

 

[m] Blueblood could only stare at the Wonderbolt. A grin found his lips.

[bb] "Spitfire is at that."

 

[m] Soarin’ laughed easily. So damn easily.

[Sor] "Not her!"

 

[Sor] "Rainbow Dash. Gotta remember that," muttered to himself.

[Sor] "I totally suck with names."

 

[bb]"I don't see how you could forget," he drolly replied.

[bb] "She's named after her color scheme."

 

[m] rd was seated opposite, Spitfire having cannily switched seats and sides. She introduced herself, her childlike glee for the Wonderbolts dissipating a bit as she reached out to shake his hooves.

 

[rd] "So you're the Prince, huh?" she asked, giving him a hard stare. Like he was an otherworldly space-pony.

 

[bb] "I am the Prince of Equestria, yes," Blueblood replied, glancing at the pegasus's hoof with some disdain.

[m], he shrugged and brusquely shook her hoof in his own.

 

[rd] "Nice to meet ya!" The multi-colored filly shook back, quite firmly.

[rd] "I'm Rainbow Dash! Future Wonderbolt and one of the Elements of Harmony! But you probably already knew about that part!"

 

[m] "Ah. Yes. Of course," he lied. This was one of the Elements of Harmony?

 

[m] Blueblood's attention wandered for a bit as Dash regaled two of her idols with chatter about Rain Booms and chasing lightning and exotic weather phenomenon.

 

[m] bb just let himself relax. Another round of drinks, and then two more, helped in that respect.

 

[m] They even all had a good laugh when Dash downed about two hundred bits worth of Royal Stables Brandy in a single gulp, leading to much coughing and repeated assurances of "I can handle it; it's cool!"

 

[m] It was so... mundane and pedestrian.

 

[m] But the Prince couldn't help but marvel - to being so carefree.

 

[m] None of it mattered, and he was starting to wonder if that was really such a bad thing.

 

[Sor] "Hey, Blueblood!" - pounded his hoof on the table.

[Sor] "Let's hear something from you, man! Story! Story!"

 

[rd] "Yeah!" Dash quickly joined in, also stomping a gold-slippered hoof.

[rd] "Let's get a story from the Prince!"

 

[m] Spitfire just smiled at him.

[Spi] "Come on. You know you want to."

 

[bb] "You want a story, is that it?"

 

[m] he didn't think anypony would be excited to hear about backroom deals or political scheming or... map making.

 

[group – rd - Spi - Sor]"Story!" "Story!" "Story!"

 

[bb] "If you insist. If you insist."

[m] He held up a hoof for some silence.

 

[bb]  "Do any of you know where the Clopagos are?"

 

[m] The three pegasi returned questioning stares.

 

[bb] "I suppose not," Blueblood continued with a sigh.

[bb] "They're islands far to the south. Tropical islands. Equatorial."

 

[m] He shook his head; tried to focus.

 

[bb] "Anyway. Some pegasi wanted permission to go down there to collect wild cloud samples. They came to me for money to fund the trip. You know, since..."

[m] He tapped his flank, and the compass rose there.

[m] "It was on the no-fly list. I got things together and even went down myself. I thought of it as a vacation; a chance to relax on a beach... far from Canterlot... far from Auntie... you know, while the pegasi did all the actual work."

 

[m] He smirked at that.

 

[bb] "There was one mare, though."

[m] He looked longingly at the ceiling.

[bb] "On the last day down there, she came down to the beach. We talked. Had a few drinks. Ate exotic fruits. Then we swam in the water and made love like Sea Ponies. That..."

[m] The Prince of Equestria sighed.

[bb] "Well... that was a good day. Why couldn't this day... be that day...?"

 

[m] He stared into his drink, his voice becoming quiet.

[bb] "Over and over again?"

 

[m] He paused, noticing the beet red blushing of the mare opposite, hiding her cheeks behind her hooves.

[m] Soarin’ was chuckling to himself, clearly having enjoyed the story.

[m] Spitfire leaned over and cleared her throat.

 

[Spi] "Well, I think it's romantic."

[m] She gave him a teasing look.

[Spi] "In the water, hm?"

 

[rd] "Y-you guys!"  Dash objected.

[rd] "Come on!"

 

[Sor] "Mid-air is the way to go," - boasted, holding up his drink.

[Sor] "Nothing like it!"

 

[m] Blueblood snorted dismissively.

[bb] "Pegasi."

 

[Sor] "Live for the moment, man!" - finished off his drink and set it down on the table, grinning broadly all the while.

[Sor] "No regrets!"

 

[bb] "Live like there's no tomorrow?" the noblepony asked, staring across the table and then to his side at the three accomplished flyers.

[m] He shook his head.

 

[bb] "And what if there literally was no tomorrow?" he asked.

[bb] "What then?"

 

[rd] "If there's no tomorrow," - spoke up, despite her embarrassment.

[m] She put her hooves on the table, her cheeks still blushing.

[rd] "Then you can just do whatever you want today!"

[m] Her rose colored eyes darted over to Soarin’ sitting next to her.

[rd] "Sounds kinda fun, actually."

 

The Wonderbolt caught the stare and grinned cheekily.

 

[bb] "You know what?"

[m] (determination)

[m] He noticed Spitfire smiling at him. There wouldn't be any objections there, it seemed.

[bb] "I think... you're right."

 

_sc_00031 (bedchamber, early morning, day 5)

 

[m] (song)

 

[m] gently turning off the radio.

 

[m] A second later, and a bed-headed Blueblood sat straight up.

 

[m] Running his hooves through his hair, Blueblood laughed. And laughed.

[m] And laughed.

 

[bb] "Yes! Goo-oood morning Canterlot!"

[m] Hopping out of bed with a spring in his step, he pulled open the curtains to take a good look at the morning

 

_sc_00032 (bed prep room, early morning, day 5)

 

[m] Ringing the bell for his chamber maids, he waited for them with an almost giddy smile.

 

[bb] "Light Touch." He pointed to the blue coated mare.

[bb] "Right? Just a quick brush over. Just get out the knots. I'm going natural today."

 

[oc-2] "But... but sir..." Light Touch very nearly protested.

[oc-2] "We were told to..."

 

[bb] "Ehhhh. It doesn't matter!" He said that with almost Dash-like glee.

[bb] "Just a quick bushing."

 

[oc-2] "If you insist, sir," Light Touch relented.

 

[m] And, if Blueblood wasn't mistaken, he actually caught Sandy smiling a bit, too.

 

Perhaps his mood was infectious?

 

_sc_00033 (dining hall, morning, day 5)

 

[bb] "Hello, Auntie! Hello Auntie!"

[m] He greeted the Princesses and the dour Household ponies around the table.

[bb] "Quite the morning today! I don't think I've seen the sun this radiant in years!"

 

[Cel] "Oh, why thank you, Blueblood,"

[m] took the compliment with due decorum while still seeming visibly pleased.

 

[m] Taking his seat, he noticed Proper Place staring at him. The old unicorn looked lost for words.

 

[bb] "Before you ask,"

[m] Blueblood gleefully held up a hoof to cut the old advisor off.

[bb] "I am looking forward to the Gala tonight, yes I did hire the Canterlot Chamber Orchestra to play for us, and I've heard their rendition of Entry of the Princess in Sun's Light is a wonder to behold."

 

[m] directed at servants

[bb] "Tea, with milk and ginger. Nothing else. I'm going out this morning."

 

[Lun] "You are?" This time, to his surprise, the question came from Luna.

[m] It was also spoken more than a little loudly.

 

[Lun] "We mean," she repeated, more quietly.

[Lun] "You are?" The dark alicorn gave him a curious look.

[Lun] "You never did so before."

 

[Cel]"That's quite true," Celestia agreed.

 

[bb] "Things change," Blueblood assured them, laughing softly at his own private joke.

[bb]"Things change."

 

_sc_00034 (outside gala entrance, evening, day 5)

 

 

[m] when a carriage rolled up.

[m]Studded with jewels in glittering, swirling, interlaced rivers and streams,

[m] it was long enough to carry a dozen ponies or more with room to spare.

[m] A collective gasp sucked the air from the varied revelers about to enter the castle grounds, and every head and every pair of eyes turned to stare.

 

[m] Royal Guards, dressed in expensive tuxedos, hurried to flank the doors of the stretch carriage.

 

[m] A cream colored leg emerged first, teasingly, tantalizingly, sporting a sparkling slipper that probably cost more than most ponies made in a year. It was followed soon after by the Pony of Pop herself, Sapphire Shores.

[m] she appeared in an intricate French Maid outfit, as saucy as it was ridiculously overpriced. Tiny diamonds caught the light along the lace filigree as the pony superstar emerged, lighting her up the center of the universe.

 

[m] A step behind her, Blueblood reveled in the scene he was making.

[m] Instead, his flanks scintillated with rhinestones, the silver spurs on his cowboy boots jingling. He'd expressly purchased the most gaudy, tacky, inappropriate and expensive ensemble within a thousand miles.

[m] A blue silk scarf and cowboy hat completed the utterly atrocious look.

 

[m] Sapphire Shores loved it.

 

[m] A hundred ponies stood, stunned, staring at the pair.

 

[m] – nothing at all – compared to the look of shock on Auntie Celestia's face when she saw the duo walk through the gate. Priceless. Beyond priceless!

 

[m] Blueblood choose that moment to propose to the Pony of Pop.

[m] Let her be the Princess of Pop!

 

[m] , accepting, they began to make out right in the center of the Royal Oratory.

 

[m] (add m6 in background? With Ra crying her eyes out?)

 

_sc_00035 (dinning hall, morning/noon, day 6)

 

[m] He began the day with a feast.

[m] When asked what he wanted for breakfast, after giving it a moment's thought, the Esteemed Prince had answered:

 

[bb] "I don't know. One of everything you can make, I suppose."

 

[m] The table had been momentarily stunned silent, broken only by wary, uncomfortable laughter.

 

[bb] "No, really,"

[bb]  "One of everything."

 

[m] One or two stuttering protests aside – together with a

[bb] "Yes, of course I'll pay for it, no Auntie, it won't ALL go to waste" –

[m]  the table was soon laden with every treat imaginable.

[m] Those that were not freshly produced by the castle staff were brought from pastry shops and high class establishments in the city proper

 

[m]It wasn't about the food. It was the spectacle.

 

[m] (scene of multiple servants maniacally running through shop to shop, shouting out the orders?)

 

[m]  Celestia had stuck around just long enough to grasp the extent of his madness. She had even partaken in a few of the freshly arriving treats, seeing it as something of a challenge to keep up with him.

[m] For an hour or more, the two Royals played a deadly game of caloric chicken, their waist lines and cholesterol levels – and pride – on the line.

 

[m] Eventually, minus the servants, only one pony remained at the table.

 

[m] Auntie Luna had remained silent the entire time, watching as her sister and nephew gorged themselves

 

[m]  Despite normally turning in to rest after a long night guiding the moon, Luna remained even after Celestia left.

 

[Lun] "Rather disgusting, isn't it?"

 

[bb] "Allow me to disagree," he replied, raising his voice to ensure she could hear him.

[m] He held up a frosting crowned confection.

[bb] "These... cupcakes... as they're called, are quite delicious!"

 

[Lun] "We were referring to your behavior," Luna's voice projected easily across the table. He knew that spell.

[Lun] "It is rather atrocious."

 

[bb] "All in the eye of the beholder," he countered, using the same spell to project his voice.

 

[m] To drive the point home, he scooped up a dollop of cream with a fresh strawberry, placing it on his tongue with an indulgent grin.

[m] Luna's face scrunched up in distaste.

[m]  Though, a second later, she did tentatively levitate over a small round breakfast treat. A 'donut' they were called. Blueblood had never condescended to try one before.

[m] That one... had sprinkles.

 

[Lun] "Gluttony is a vice we have seen consume more than a few ponies,"

[m] nibbling at the donut experimentally.

[m] As always, she was prim and proper;

 

[bb] "I'm not worried about that,"

[m] , floating over a donut of his own and eating it in one bite.

 

[Lun] "We find that hard to believe. In our experience, you appear to care a great deal what others think of you."

[m] Luna took a small bite of her pastry, smiling as she found it to her liking.

[Lun] "Our sister in particular."

 

[m] Blueblood frowned at the observation.

 

[bb] "Yes, well."

[m] He glanced away, to try and find something new to try.

[bb] "Not anymore."

 

[m] Luna was silent for a time, as she finished her donut.

 

[Lun] "So you say,"

[m] standing up to leave.

[m] Her guards quickly moved to flank her as she left.

[Lun] "Yet,"

[m] she added over her shoulder,

[Lun] "We can't help but find your desire for attention rather pathetic. We will leave you to your repast."

 

[m] Blueblood followed the alicorn with his eyes before staring at a plate of sweet cakes, layered in a rainbow of colors in jam.

[m] He willed a fork to take a bite, but found his appetite – with his audience – gone.

[m] Raising a napkin to the corner of his mouth, he wiped away a smudge of jelly.

 

 

 

_sc_00036 (dining hall, morning, day 7)

 

 

[oc-pp] "Prince Blueblood."

 

[bb] "Proper Place. You look well."

 

[oc-pp ] "Yes, thank you. I trust you are looking forward to this Evening's Gala? I have heard you hired from the Canterlot Chamber Orchestra company? I look forward to their rendition of Entry of the Princess in Sun's Light."

 

[bb] "As... do I, Chamberlain. As do I."

 

[m]  He just.. couldn't quite look at the plates of food the same way.

[m] Out of curiosity, he beckoned over a servant and requested an identical serving to what Celestia had: the oats and apples he had always derided

 

 

[m] couldn't help but glance in the direction of his other Aunt. The one he had never known.

 

[bb] "Auntie," Blueblood spoke up, sensing he was almost out of time.

 

[m] Celestia immediately set her eyes on him, but it wasn't her he meant to address –

 

[bb] "Auntie Luna," he said again,

[m] dark Princess gave him a nonplussed look, unused to being addressed when her sister was present.

[bb] "What is it like...? To be immortal?"

 

[m] Next to her, Celestia raised an eyebrow at the strange question.

 

[m] Luna set her hooves against her chest and lowered her eyes.

[Lun] "Why... are you asking us that?"

 

[bb] "I guess, the bigger question is," Blueblood continued, raising his chin,

[bb] "when you're destined to live forever, what do you do with your life? I mean. Besides what you have to? How do you live with it?"

 

[m] Like before, it took a second or two for Luna to really determine how to respond.

 

[Lun] "One simply does,"

[m] she answered, standing up to leave.

 

[m] He watched her go, and sighed.

 

[m] not the answer he was looking for.
