_sc_00001 (bedchamber, early morning,  day 45)

 

[m] (song)

 

[m] Blueblood opened his eyes.

 

He remembered falling asleep in his study, Rarity curled up next to him.

 

[m] He remembered: he had tried to stay up. He had. To the sound of her soft snoring, he had studied her features and talked aloud about mazes and maps and noble gossip and juicy court rumors, long after she had tired of telling him about her friends, Ponyville, her sister and her work.

 

[m] They discussed the merits of archery versus falconry, and she recounted the adventure she had trekking through Everfree and meeting a sea serpent named Steven, winning him over at the cost of an unseasonably short-cut tail.

[m] The last thing he recalled was resting his head and his eyes, knowing she was already fast asleep.

 

[m] Resting his front leg against his face, Prince Blueblood sucked in a shuddering breath. It had been hundreds of loops since he had cried.

[m] Muffled sounds escaped his lips. Part of him wanted to stay in bed: to just lay in place and relive a shadow of that fleeting moment of happiness he had captured... that he had shared...

 

[m] This was the first time he hurt.

 

[m] Light filtered in through a crack in the curtains, reminding him that, as attractive as it was to do nothing, he had made a promise to himself: every day, an opportunity.

 

[m] Inhaling, fortifying his resolve, Blueblood forced himself out of bed and opened the curtains to take in the Gardens below.

 

[m] Taking a few seconds longer than usual to stare at the maze in the distance, he rang the bell for his chambermaids.

[m] He'd tried to be upbeat, and he told himself again and again he still would be, no matter what happened.

 

[m] His heart wasn't as compliant as his brain. It felt stressed, stretched, and worn.

 

[bb] "Good morning Light Touch. Sandy,"

[m] he greeted the pair, and turned his head to stare at his reflection. It was the same as always.

 

[oc-2] "My Prince?"

[m] Light Touch asked, carefully, sensing something was amiss.

 

[m] He smirked, haltingly.

 

[bb] "Tonight's the Gala, isn't it, Sandy?"

[m] he asked, smiling pleasantly at the shy servant filly.

 

[oc-2] "Yes... sir..." she muttered.

 

[m] He levitated a brush out of her hooves.

[bb] "I'm going for a little walk."

 

_sc_00002 (garden – maze with statues, early morning,  day 45)

 

 

[m] Discord.

 

[m] He stood before the supposedly inert statue.

 

[m] (maybe make a reverb echo of Cel voice of below as a alternative flashback ?)

[bb] "You're clearly distraught, but no magic on Equestria could have the effect you describe. Even Discord himself couldn't cast such a spell. ... Probably."

 

[m] He had not forgotten Celestia's words, said in passing, so long ago.

 

[bb] "If I released you..."

[m] He wondered aloud, believing that just maybe it could hear him.

[bb] "Could you save me?"

 

[m] He reached for the cold stone, his hoof rushing against a scaled leg.

 

[bb] "Could you kill me?" he asked, more quietly.

 

[bb] "Even Discord himself couldn't cast such a spell. ... Probably."

 

[m] It was just the two of them, alone, in that garden. No pony could stop him in time. No pony could blame him. It was tempting. So terribly, silently, agonizingly tempting.

 

[bb] "I could,"

[m] he said, but turned away.

[bb] "But it seems I can't."

 

[m] He gave the stone prison a passing pat on the foot, and walked back to the castle

 

[bb] "I think... tonight... is going to be all right..."

 

 

_sc_00003 (gala entrance, early evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[m] The stagecoach pulled up and Spike made a pair of quick jumps down to the ground

 

 

[m] Bowing as he waited for the door to the carriage to open, he was rewarded with a real sight: the six mares inside were positively glowing with anticipation and excitement, looking outright amazing in their dresses.

 

[m] He stood aside and listened as they began a musical number.

 

[m] so Spike simply took it in stride and tapped his foot as it played out.

 

 

[m]  Alone on the red carpet, Spike could do little more than stare at the retreating hindquarters of his friends

[m] Twilight – running off to see Celestia. Of course. Rainbow Dash – off to gush over the Wonderbolts. Big surprise. Pinkie Pie – off to tear up the dance floor somewhere. Made sense. Applejack – off to set up shop. Sooner was better than later, he supposed. Fluttershy – beeline right for the gardens.

[m] Then there was Rarity – off to find love.

 

[m] Spike sighed.

 

[m] Until then, well, he could wait around the gate... so they could find him when the time came.

 

[m] It was in the midst of doing so, when a rumble in the little dragon's stomach prompted him to cover his mouth.

[m] It felt like a letter from Celestia, but now, of all times?

[m] Turning his head, he coughed, and the ash from his sputtering green flame came together, congealing into a curled paper note.

[m] Reflexively opening it while looking for Twilight – it had to be for her – he caught the line on the top.

 

[Spi] "Wait a second,"

[m] he said to himself, re-reading it.

[Spi] "It's for... me?"

 

_sc_00003 (gala - opening stairs, early evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[m] Twilight ran up the steps of the Oratory, slowing as she noticed not one Royal personage, or even two, but three waiting for her.

[m] Waiting for and greeting all the guests.

[m] Celestia was actually off to the side slightly, rather than the center of attention, as a dark alicorn gestured and inclined her head politely to the sets of incoming guestponies.

 

[ts] "Princess Luna?"

[m] she couldn't help but wonder, stopping a few steps short of the forked platform that crowned the Oratory staircase.

 

[Lun] "Twilight Sparkle!" the Princess of the Night announced, loudly.

[Lun] "We welcome you to this year's Gala celebration! There will be much feasting and boasting and drinking this night!"

[m] She cringed a little, lowering her voice.

[Lun] "Though, actually, we have been told the feasting and drinking has been refined somewhat over the last thousand years."

 

[Cel] "Still a great deal of boasting, however,"

[m] Celestia chimed in, walking closer and motioning her student closer.

[Cel] "Come, Twilight. We are both glad to see you."

 

[Lun] "Yes! We would thank you for your actions freeing us from Nightmare Moon,"

[m] The Lunar Maiden held out her gilded, silver hoof.

 

[ts] "Happy... to have helped?"

[m] Twilight shook the dark alicorn's hoof, surprised that she was more gentle with her grip than she was in toning down her speaking voice.

 

[bb] "Miss Sparkle,"

[m] another voice spoke, and a large white unicorn trotted up, also offering his hoof.

[m] This had to be the one mortal member of the royal family, Prince Blueblood.

 

[m] There was a rumor around Ponyville of all places that he had been seen there. Twilight shook his hoof and he smiled pleasantly.

 

[ts] "Princess."

[m] Twilight quickly turned her attention to her mentor.

[ts] "I was hoping we could talk tonight. I have so much to tell you!"

 

[m] Celestia's violet eye narrowed as she tried to explain:

[Cel] "I'm quite busy at the moment, but later I'm sure we..."

 

[bb] "It occurs to me, Auntie,"

[m]  Blueblood interrupted, giving a short hmm,

[bb]  "that the rules specify the Princess should be present to welcome guests for the Gala. Not... necessarily... which... Princess."

 

[m] The immortal alicorn's smile widened, just enough for those who knew her to recognize it.

 

[Cel] "Quite a liberal interpretation of the rules, nephew."

[m] She leaned down, and whispered among the four of them.

[Cel] "I like it. I'll be back to check on you two sooner or later."

 

[m] Twilight grinned, ear to ear, and trotted after her mentor and idol.

 

[m] Luna watched the pair go with a quizzical eyebrow.

[m] She then turned to her estranged nephew.

 

[Lun] "One would almost think you planned that ahead of time,"

[m] she stated, a smile on her face.

 

[bb] "One would,"

[m] Blueblood agreed, and waved to another of the arriving guests: a pair ascending the steps, no doubt to distract her.

[m] Luna chuckled, and prepared to meet the next group of ponies, her nephew by her side. Regardless of whether he had any other motive behind talking her into attending, the fact was that she was here, now, and determined to see the night through.

 

[m] When Blueblood had personally asked her to attend the night's celebrations, she had initially tried to dismiss him. The Gala was the social event of the year, after all, and it was wiser to start small and work one's way up.

 

[m] Her estranged nephew, however, had a surprising way with words. He also seemed to know every single mare and stallion in Canterlot, and was willing to make introductions for her without making her seem like an accessory. She wondered if his current scheme, whatever it was, was also what had called him away from the Palace so abruptly and repeatedly throughout the day?

 

[bb] "Lady Flare,"

[m] he identified the mare first, then her date.

[bb] "Hoity. How nice of you two to make it!"

 

{Lun] "Indeed!"

[m] Luna thundered, greeting them in her own way, Canterlot speaking voice on full roar.

[Lun] "We are Princess Luna, and in the name of the Royal Family, we welcome you to our Gala!"

 

_sc_00004 (gala - opening stairs, early evening,  day 46++)

 

[m] Rarity couldn't help but notice that she had been on the receiving end of a strange look from the Prince when she introduced herself to him – and to Princess Luna.

 

[m] Not only did he know who she was, a fact that had filled her with glee at the time, but he had kissed her hoof. An action she had not seen him repeat with any number of other esteemed and important guests of court.

[m] She was still a bit flushed and flattered, but there was a degree of curiosity coloring her thoughts as well. He must have heard of her somewhere.

 

[m] Yet there was little time for pleasantries.

 

[bb] "Miss Rarity,"

[m] he had said with a sly grin.

[bb] "I may impose on you for a dance later."

 

[m]  A long line of guests were gathering to introduce themselves to their new, returned, Princess Sovereign and there was no time to linger. Luna was a new item, and even with Celestia not present, novelty attracted high society.

 

[m] The poor Princess was greeting guests in groups of four or more. Remaining close by – not necessarily to eavesdrop, but just to see – Rarity happened to overhear how the Prince was listing off every guest, by rote and by name and title.

 

[m] Well, him knowing her now seemed less surprising.

 

[m] It was hard to mistake Hoity Toity, for example, but Rarity had not known the mare with him.

 

[m] In the interim, Rarity busied herself by mixing and mingling with some of the other socialites upstairs.

[m] Checking a large, antique clock on display between two of the Ménagerie wings, she also wondered how her friends were getting along.

 

_sc_00005 (gala - outside, early evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[Sor] "My pie! You saved it!"

 

[m]  Not wanting to risk another accident, he placed it on the floor and started to dig in.

 

[Spi] "Hey, I know you!"

[Spi] "You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won the Best Flyer's competition!"

 

[rd] "Hay, yeah!"

[m] The light blue pegasus boasted, basking in the glow of recognition.

[rd] "Name's Rainbow Dash!"

 

[Spi] "Well, Rainbow Dash, it looks like your skills saved us again."

[m] Spitfire smirked and glanced over to the side, where her partner was already half finished stuffing his face.

[Spi] "Or, well, at least they saved Soarin’'s apple pie."

 

[m] The stallion's response was affirmative, though muffled by chunks of baked pastry.

 

[rd] "Wanna come hang out with us?"

[m] she then asked, motioning over to the VIP lounge.

 

[rd] "Sure."

[m] Dash played it – terribly obviously – coy.

[rd] "Why not?"

 

[Spi] "Funny story,"

Spitfire added, leading her through security.

[Spi] "There was some kind of weird scheduling mistake, so Soarin’ and I are free all night."

 

[m] (maybe have them two shown in the civilian outfits?)

 

_sc_00006 (gala - outside, early evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[m] Applejack was not a happy pony.

 

[oc-2]  "Pardon me."

 

[m] (pretty sure it’s the two morning servants)

 

[m] Applejack looked up, the cup of her hoof making a 'pop' as she pulled it free of her cheek.

 

[m] This pony wore clean but simple clothes in white and black with a bit of pink.

[m] She was a unicorn, with a light blue coat – lighter than Dash's – and a pinkish-red mane, done back into a neat bun. With her was another mare, the same age or maybe a little younger, with a chocolate coat and dark blonde mane. They didn't seem to be guests at all. In fact, if Applejack had to guess, they were... servants?

 

[oc-2] "I was wondering if I could have one of your apples?"

[m] the more talkative of the pair asked, pointing to one apple in particular.

 

[aj] "Sure thing, sugar cube!"

[m] Applejack cheered inwardly at finally getting another sale. She faced the other mare.

[aj] "Hungry? Anything I can get for ya?"

 

[oc-1] "Could I have a... candy apple?"

[m] the dark brown filly asked. Her bashfulness could probably give Fluttershy a run for her money.

 

[aj] "One candy apple, comin' right up!"

[m] Plucking the confection off its tray, Applejack added a little napkin so it was easier to hold onto and eat. "Enjoy!"

 

[m] With a jingle, four bits fell into her purse.

 

[m] The two serving girls didn't waste time before starting to eat. By the looks on their faces, they were happy, satisfied customers

 

[??] "Excuse me, Miss."

[m] A stallion's voice this time.

 

[m] She looked up, and saw a colt in a prim white and black vest. There were two others with him.

 

[m] More servants?

 

[??] "We heard you were sellin' applies,"

[m] the leader of the trio continued.

 

[m] Applejack's spirits rose.

[aj] "Yer darn tootin' I am!"

 

_sc_00007  (gala - garden, early evening,  day 46++)

 

[fs] "I'm so-oo sorry to have scared you, my friends!"

[m] Fluttershy called to all the little critters in hiding, the line of rope between her teeth.

[fs] "But... I'm leaving now... so you can all come out!"

 

[m] Ducking quickly behind one of the many festive iron arches, she peeked out from around the corner to watch the fruits of her labor.

 

 

[m] A strangely sinister laughter bubbled up from her throat in a voice she hardly recognized as her own.

 

[m] Part of her Gala dress snagged on a nearby rose bush that wound around the hedge, the thorn ripping free one of her little blue butterfly ornaments. Fluttershy ignored it.

 

[m] Little things like that could be patched up later. All she had to focus on now was waiting for the 'crunch-crunch' sound of some adorable animal, nibbling on the bait!

 

[m] Pop!

 

[m] Odd. Animals didn't go "pop." Balloons went "pop" but not animals.

 

[m] She opened her eyes, and saw a large pair of hooves in front of her. It was connected to a pony, a unicorn pony – oh dear, unicorns went 'pop' didn't they – and he didn't seem happy.

[m] It wasn't even that strange but harmless groundskeeper who kept getting in the way of her catching... making... an animal friend tonight.

[m] This was a large, pure white, important looking pony.

 

[m] (pop is the teleport sound? I guess)

[m] (maybe use more of “whoosh” sound than pop? Need more audio references)

 

[m] Fluttershy also realized, then, that she had a rope in her mouth. A rope that led around the corner to a trap. A trap meant for an animal. An animal that was living in Celestia's private garden. Oh dear.

 

[bb] "Miss,"

[bb] "May I ask what you're doing out here?"

 

[fs] "Oh. Um. I."

[m] She shrank down, her pink mane covering her face.

[fs] "I was being assertive?"

 

[m] He held out a hoof, not angrily, but expecting to help her up.

 

[m] Fluttershy dropped the rope, took his offer, and stood.

[m] Standing up, she could see that he was just as big, and still as intimidating, especially since he had caught her being quite... improper.

 

[bb] "You must be Miss Fluttershy,"

[m] the unicorn said, and she nodded meekly.

 

[fs] "Um. Yes. You... know me?"

[m] Probably because of her time as a model. She cringed at how famous that had made her, especially in certain circles.

 

[bb] "I've seen your picture,"

[bb] "Let's go put away that... trap of yours. I don't think it would work too well anyway."

 

[m] (rework the dialogue a bit, maybe it’s the fs wondering why he knows her and bb response by reminding her of fashion photos?)

 

[fs] "What was wrong with my trap?"

[m] She asked, feeling a bit defensive... and apparently self-incriminating.

[fs] "I mean. If you don't mind me asking? I mean. Not that... I was... um."

 

[bb] "Is that a carrot?"

[m] The only 'wildlife' nearby was that old groundskeeper, as usual.

 

[fs] "I, um, got it from the buffet."

 

[bb] "The only raw carrots on the menu should be served on a bed of rice."

[m] He levitated the crispy root into the air and tossed it over to the groundskeeper. Despite having his eyes closed, the old pony managed to snag it out of midair with a snap of his jaws.

 

[mule] "M-m-m!"

[m] He groused to himself.

[mule] "De-licious!"

 

[m] Floating up the cardboard box, the stallion snapped it at the corners and folded it up into a neat square.

[m]  Fluttershy bowed her head, fully expecting to be either reprimanded for her behavior,

 

[m] Tears welled up in her eyes at the spectacle she'd end up making.

 

[bb] "Miss Fluttershy,"

[m] the unicorn's voice prompted her to look up.

[bb] "Please don't cry. You aren't in trouble."

 

[fs] "I'm not?"

[m] she asked, sounding heartbreakingly hopeful.

 

[m] He shook his head.

[bb] "No. The animals in the Gardens aren't normal, you know."

 

[fs] "They... aren't?"

[m] Fluttershy asked, curiosity displacing worry. Her wings flexed happily, but then stilled as his words sunk in.

[fs] "What do you mean?"

 

[bb] "That kangaroo over there, looking at us from behind that bush –"

 

[m] He pointed a hoof to one of the hedges. The Wallaroo that she had seen before, but been unable to catch, was keeping a wary eye on them from behind the barrier. Its mouth was moving slowly as it chewed and stared.

 

[bb] "That animal was poached from a royal game reserve three years ago,"

[bb] "Its owner wanted it as an exotic pet."

 

[fs] "Oh,"

[m] Fluttershy gasped, frowning.

[fs] "That's not nice."

 

[bb] "It also kicked a pony, hurting them badly,"

[bb] "It's here, because Auntie Celestia didn't want it put down, and because it can't survive in the wild anymore."

 

[fs] "That's terrible. That's... just terrible."

 

[m]  Fluttershy wasn't one to get angry easily, but she really wished she had some way of righting what had happened to that poor creature.

[m] Her expression fell, dejected, as she realized that just moments ago, she had been chasing that same kangaroo.

 

[bb] "That vulture up there,"

[bb] "was brought in for falconry. Some foal believed he could train it like a common goshawk or kestrel. Almost every animal in this garden was captured wild. Most never saw a pony before they came here and many have been treated poorly.

 

[bb]"Miss Fluttershy,"

[bb] "Please. Look at me."

[m] She did, and saw that he was smiling amiably, just a hint of sadness in his eyes.

[bb] "You're going to have to be very patient with them."

 

[fs] "But I only have one night," she muttered.

 

[bb] "You can always come back, I promise,"

[m] he assured her, leaning down a little to keep eye contact.

[bb] "You can't rush friendship, now can you?"

 

[m] She blinked the last of the tears from her eyes, and steadied herself.

 

[fs] "It took weeks for Angel Bunny to become my friend,"

[m] remembered, and nodded to herself, determination in her eyes.

[fs] "Thank you so much!"

[m] She reached out, as if to hug the strange unicorn, and blushed, tucking her hooves in.

[fs] "I mean. Thank you."

 

[bb] "It was my pleasure,"

[m] he replied, still smiling despite her embarrassment.

[bb] "If you like, I can help for a little while. I've had a lot of time to practice my bird calls recently, and I can introduce you to my young tercel, Dream Catcher."

 

[fs] "That – that would be wonderful,"

[m] Fluttershy agreed, feeling better than she had all evening.

[fs] "Um. But. You know who I am... but I'm afraid I don't know you. What's your name?"

 

_sc_00008  (gala dance floor, early evening,  day 46++)

 

 

"I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala~

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala~

I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala..."

 

[m] Pinkie Pie sighed, alone at her table.

 

[m] No one wanted to dance. No one especially wanted to dance with her after the spectacle she had made when she first came in. Everypony was avoiding

 

[m] Not a single pony had even once used the dance floor.

 

[m]  Why were all these ponies here, in the fancy, expensive DANCE room, if they weren't going to dance?

 

[Oct] "Um. Pardon, everypony,"

[m]  a voice from the stage caused her ears to perk up.

[m] She cleared her throat again.

[Oct]  "We've had a special request for a rather unorthodox song. Please bear with us."

 

[m] (bit of random idea but maybe swap the Oct in previous chapter being saved for Tuba?)

 

[m] Pinkie's ear did another little twitch.

 

[spik] "Hey, everypony!" That voice!

 

[m] Looking up, Pinkie saw Spike sitting next to the piano pony, going over a sheet of music.

[m] She tilted her head in bemusement. What was Spike doing here?

 

[m] After a few seconds of prep time, Spike and the pianist, Sharp Note, began to play.

[m] The latter also slipped on a pair of sunglasses and cleared his throat in preparation for a vocal score.

 

[m] Twitchy-twitch.

 

[m] Soon a trumpet and saxophone started up, bringing home a tune Pinkie knew from somewhere. Not only her ear now, but her left hoof was twitching too. Her back hoof was also tapping, but that was due to the beat, not any sort of Pinkie Sense in action. Something was definitely about to happen!

 

[spik] (singing)

"Well I heard about the fellow you've been dancing with

All over the neighborhood

So why didn't you ask me baby

Or didn't you think I could?"

 

"Well I know that the boogaloo is out of sight

but the shingaling's the thing tonight

But if that was you and me a now baby

I would have shown you how to do it right!"

 

"Do it right (Uh-huh)

Do it right (Do it right)

Do it right

Do it rightttt!

Aaahhhh!"

 

[m] Too late. Her body was already flying out onto the dance floor!

 

[m] And, to her surprise (silly pony, didn't I warn you?) she wasn't alone.

 

[m] (its bb on the floor)

 

[m] For the first time this evening, somepony else was out on the dance floor, too!

[m] He was a unicorn, not really Pinkie's type, but he was dancing, and he was pretty good!

[m] She reared up and he grabbed one of her hooves, spinning her around in crazy circles.

[m] She hardly registered the shocked gasps of so many of the other staid and scandalized partygoers.

 

"Twistin', shake it shake it shake it shake it baby!

Hey we gonna loop de loop

Shake it out baby!

Hey we gonna loop de la!"

 

[m] To her delight, he joined her in bending over and shaking his rear, his dark golden tail swishing scandalously against her dress.

 

"Bend over let me see ya shake your tailfeather

Bend over let me see ya shake your tailfeather

Come on let me see ya shake your tailfeather

Come on let me see ya shake your tailfeather

Aaahhhh!"

 

[m] Spinning around, Pinkie stood on two legs and kicked in time to the music, bouncing and laughing as he joined her. It seemed impossible, but she couldn't help but wonder if this special request had been for her? (This was fun.) It was super duper fun with cherries on top!

 

"Do the twist!"

 

[m] Her dress swung from side to side and she flexed her hips.

 

"Do the fly!"

 

Flapping front legs switched from the 'buzz'  –

 

"Do the swim!"

 

– to the 'sea pony'  –

 

"And do the bird!"

 

– to the 'flailing pegasus'  –

 

"Well do the duck!"

 

– Pinkie always thought this one should have been called 'the chicken'  –

 

"Aaah, and do the monkey!"

 

– front legs and hooves swinging, she faced to the side, bounced around opposite, and then faced him again.

 

"Hey hey, watusi!"

 

Stepping closer, the two held out their front legs and shifted from hoof to hoof.

 

"What about the boogaloo?

Oh, the bony marony!

And, ah, what about the food?

Aaahhhh!

Twistin', shake it shake it shake it shake it baby!"

 

[m] By the time the song finished, Pinkie was ready to collapse into giggles.

 

 

[m] It was just too bad that, before she could say anything, the orchestral ponies quickly (too quickly, that was fun) switched to a slower, more traditional song.

 

[m] On the verge of returning to her table, happy at least to have had one fun dance, the pink party pony was surprised when a white foreleg stuck out to intercept her. Eyes wide, she realized her unknown partner was asking her to stay on the dance floor.

 

[m] Even though it wasn't the same dance as before.

 

[m] Even though everypony was still staring at them!

 

[bb] "Don't tell me you're tired already?"

[m] the white unicorn asked with a cheeky grin.

[bb] "Pinkamena."

 

[pp] "Oh!"

[m] She gasped, but didn't do the normal briefly-suspend-oneself-in-midair trick. She would have, except he intercepted her in that, too, forcing her to stay on the ground.

 

[pp] "Do you know me from somewhere?!"

[m] she asked, leaning closer.

 

[bb] "I've heard about you,"

[m] he replied, tapping his hoof on the dance floor.

[bb] "Come on. Don't you want to know how to dance to this music, too?"

 

[pp] "I do!"

 

 

_sc_00009  (gala dance floor (lots of characters), early evening,  day 46++)

 

[m] (this is going to be a long sequence, maybe it will need to broke into its own part)

 

[m]  the Ménagerie Ursae?

 

[m] It was packed; more than a hundred ponies had to be either in the room or trying to get in, forced instead into adjacent salons. Tables had been pushed back and up against the walls, and the air was filled with not just music, but the sound of a hundred hooves moving on the polished floor.

 

[m] Rarity had been waiting for Princess Luna to finish with her introductions, welcoming the last of the gentry to the Gala.

[m] At some point, however, she and her nephew had vanished. Convinced more than ever that she needed to find her would-be date for the evening, the fashionable unicorn moved from chamber to chamber, trying to catch sight or wind of him. As it was, some ponies did claim to have seen him, just rarely in the same place for terribly long.

 

[aj] "Hey there! Sugar cube!"

[aj] "Rarity! Hey, over here!"

 

[m] Craning her neck, she saw the unmistakable hat that only Applejack would be wearing here.

[m] Squeezing through the crowd, Rarity quickly found not one but two of her missing friends: Applejack -, Fluttershy softly muttering an apology every time she bumped into another pony.

[m]  Applejack was all smiles and greeted her warmly with a hug, and despite her nervousness, even Fluttershy seemed to be in good spirits and she daintily touched hooves with her friend.

 

[ra] "My word," Rarity remarked, seeing - in such a jovial state.

[ra] "Don't you look like the cat that ate the canary!"

 

[aj] "I reckon I have a right'ta!"

[m] , tipping her hat back.

[aj] "I darn near sold out tonight. Just put the rest of it away out back."

[m] She pointed back behind her in the general direction of where their carriage was parked.

[aj] "Figured I'd spend the rest of the night seein' how everypony else was doin'."

 

[ra] "Well, that's good news!"

[ra] "What about you, Fluttershy? I rather expected you'd still be in the gardens?"

 

[fs] "Oh. Um. I mostly just came back to get something to eat,"

[fs] . "I also wanted to thank... somepony.. for helping me."

 

[aj] "Ah knew there was another reason why ya came in, all blushin' like that!"

[m] Applejack threw a less-than-subtle wink Fluttershy's way.

 

[fs] "It isn't like that!"

[m] the pegasus protested, and shrunk back a bit.

[fs] "I mean. Not really. Blueblood is very nice, and he even found a groundhog for me, but it isn't like that."

 

[ra] "Prince Blueblood?"

[m] Rarity asked, tilting her head in confusion.

[ra] "You saw him out in the gardens?"

 

[m] Fluttershy nodded.

[fs]"He stopped me from... making a mistake... and since I am getting a little hungry, I sort of wondered where he had gone to?"

 

[aj] "Well, we can look for 'im and everypony else,"

[m] Applejack said with a grin.

[aj] "We got plenty o' time before the dinner spread. You seen any o' our party around, Rarity?"

 

[ra] "Yes, well,"

[m] Rarity gave her a brief rundown, dismissing some of her surprise at Fluttershy's news,

[ra] "Rainbow's probably still with the Wonderbolts. I checked the lounge a little while ago but didn't see her. I'm sure Pinkie Pie is in the ballroom somewhere. Twilight disappeared with the Princess. Princess Celestia, of course... and, no, I have no idea where Blueblood is, so don't even ask."

 

[just use SmaPan] "If you'll excuse the interruption."

[m] A monocled earth pony, who happened to be listening in by proximity, pointed towards the dance floor.

[just use SmaPan] "I couldn't help but overhear. You must not have heard? They're both out there."

 

[ra] "Out where?"

[m] Rarity asked, and squeaked as Applejack began leading her through the crowd, Fluttershy close behind.

[m] Much less polite about it than the cultured unicorn, the farmpony was both willing and able to push through when mares or stallions didn't readily yield to right of way.

[m] In their wake could be heard muttered,

[fs] "oh, sorry. sorry about that. oh. sorry. oops. sorry."

 

[m] What they soon saw left the fashionista's jaw agape.

 

[m] Celestia herself was on the dance floor, wings unfurled and head swaying to the music as she glided around and in step with her nephew, moving freely and easily to the ballroom music.

[m] By simple virtue of size, color, and incomparable presence, she was the center of attention, but the immortal Princess was far from the only one dancing.

 

[m] A pink bundle of energy, one Pinkamena Diane Pie, was close by, dancing with another mare who could only be Twilight Sparkle.

 

[m] All around them, dozens of other ponies were also paired off and enjoying themselves.

[m] Even Princess Luna was present, sipping from a long straw at a table, surrounded by a rainbow of would-be and seemingly emboldened suitors.

 

[pp] "Oh! Oh! Over here!"

[m] Pinkie Pie bounced straight up in the air, waving her front legs.

[pp] "Oh! Hey!"

 

[aj] "Aw, Pinkie, yes, sugar, we see you!"

[m] Applejack blushed at the antics of her friend, waving to make sure she could stop telegraphing their presence to the entire world.

 

[ra] "The Princess is...?"

[m] Rarity was still gaping at the sight.

[ra] "I don't believe it..."

 

[m] Then her face fell along with her prospects.

 

[ra] "I'll never be able to dance with him now..."

 

[m] Impossibly, Pinkie Pie's front legs stretched to pull them in closer once they entered Pinkie-range. The dynamo of energy wrapped her front legs around their shoulders and she started chattering at high speed, trying to fill their ears on current events.

 

[m] A pink whirl later, and she'd switched Twilight with Applejack, trying to teach another friend the dance steps she had learned.

[m] Partnered with Twilight, Rarity settled into an easy place-step. The tired unicorn prodigy breathed a sigh of relief in not having to keep pace with their earth pony friend's boundless energy.

 

[ra] "Darling, you have to tell me, please,"

[m] Rarity leaned in so she could be heard.

[ra] "What's going on?"

 

[ts] "Oh, I'm not too sure myself,"

[ts] "This isn't anything like the Galas I read about."

[m]  She glanced over her shoulder at her mentor.

[ts] "But... the Princess sure seems to be enjoying herself."

 

[ra] "That's well and nice, but..."

[m] She sighed.

[ra] "I guess I missed my chance."

 

[m] Rarity couldn't help but glance past Twilight to where Celestia and Blueblood each had a hoof extended, swinging back and forth and ducking their heads in and out, manes shaking from the movement.

[m] The Princess whooped as he reared and she did the same, hooves playfully batting in midair.

[m] It was so... strange to see the normally dignified Celestia giggling and laughing at her own antics. Her nephew, too, seemed to be enjoying himself as they danced to the lively musical ensemble with its challenging piano score.

 

[m] It took a second for Rarity to realize Twilight was staring, too, though probably more at her mentor than at the stallion.

[m] The dressmaker smiled knowingly and leaned close to the other unicorn.

 

[ra] "Why Twilight,"

[m] she cooed.

[ra] "Are you jealous?"

 

[ts] "N-n-no!"

[m] The bookworm too-quickly looked away, a faint blush darkening her cheeks.

[m]  "Why would I be jealous? I mean, what would I be jealous of? ...About... nothing."

 

[ra] "If you say so, darling."

[m] Rarity stuck out her front leg.

[ra] "Once around?"

 

[m] Mimicking what she had seen Celestia and Blueblood do, Twilight touched her leg to Rarity's and the pair of mares spun around. It wasn't the most graceful move, but it was fun and they laughed.

[m] Rarity put aside her other worries for the moment and focused on helping Twilight work on her steps.

 

[m] Abruptly, the music became a slower, but still energetic concerto, punctuated with a bassoon instrumental solo.

[m] It reminded Rarity of the countryside, the day after Winter Wrap Up

 

[bb] "Pardon me."

 

[m] Suddenly, Rarity's partner was taken aside, spun, and switched for another.

[m] The studious mare only had time for an 'eep!' followed promptly by,

[ts] "Princess Celestia? When did...?"

[Cel] "Twilight! Isn't this a pleasant surprise? Oh. But maybe I should lead, dear."

 

[bb] "I hope you don't mind me pulling a switch like that,"

[m] her new partner apologized, but clearly didn't mean it.

[bb] "Miss Rarity."

 

[ra] "Prince Blueblood?"

[m] She almost stumbled in surprise but quickly adjusted her steps to match his.

[ra] "How... forward..."

 

[bb] "Oh?"

[m] he asked, playfully.

[bb] "Did you wish to dance with one of your other friends? Miss Pinkamena perhaps? I can –"

 

[ra] "Absolutely not!"

[m] Rarity had to stop him with a crystal-slippered hoof.

 

[bb] "Good!"

[m] he declared with an agreeable laugh.

 

[m] They danced slowly and easily among the crowd of ponies,

[m] and as they did, Rarity envisioned what it must have looked like, to have this stallion change partners from Celestia, of all ponies, to her.

[m] The thought brought an ebullient blush to her cheeks.

 

[m] One musical piece turned to two, and then to three, the time flying by.

 

[bb] "Miss Rarity,"

[m] he ducked his head to ask in a conspiratorial whisper, catching her daydreaming.

[bb] "What do you think of this year's Gala?"

 

[ra] "It's different,"

[m] she answered, diplomatically.

[ra] "Not in a bad way. But then... I haven't been to a Gala before tonight."

 

[m] She leaned a little closer to him, hiding her face as she asked,

[ra] "What do you think?"

 

[bb] "I think..."

[m[ He seemed to think about it for a second.

[bb] "I think this is the best Gala yet."

 

[m] Spinning her around, Blueblood brushed his lips close to her ear.

 

[bb] "I should warn you," he whispered.

[bb] "I promised a little dragon that he could dance with you, so I won't have you all to myself tonight."

 

 

_sc_00010  (gardens but away from most of the gala, evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[ra] "Aren't you done yet?"

 

[bb] "You know, you had a comparatively easy one."

 

[ra] "Can I at least turn around?"

 

[bb] "I'm almost done. Hold your horses."

 

[ra] "Very funny."

 

[bb] "You know, I completely forgot, I could just have used magic to do this."

 

[ra] "You haven't been...? Are you teasing me again, Prince Blueblood?"

 

[bb] "Perhaps, perhaps. Okay. Done."

 

It was approaching midnight, and Blueblood had escaped from the Gala after dinner. It was a special, specific time: there were no more emergencies or distractions. Just complications. The Gala itself would continue for another hour or so before the Princesses formally retired, signaling the end of the celebration. He had even booked a last minute performance to end the night with a bang, right before the fireworks display: a certain wayward illusionist down on her luck. Hopefully that mare could manage to contain herself and not insult any of the nobles in attendance.

 

[m] Before then, Blueblood had headed outside.

 

[m] He turned around and marveled at the topiary Rarity had cut.

 

[m]  It wasn't simply a matter of practice: she had a real, genuine skill for this, a fact he had learned well.

[m]  Next to her, the columnar hedge had been cut into the shape of his cutie mark.

 

[m] Even the proportions were spot-on. The plant itself was still alive, and glowed faintly with her magic from the transformation. It really was impressive that she could use pure magic to transform a living thing, even one as simple as a plant, without really harming it.

 

[m] Beside him, he had cut and arranged a trio of diamonds, using magic to keep the plant alive, warp it here and there, and even out the edges – and fill in the occasional natural hole. Rarity's mark had the diamonds separate from one another, so he had needed to carefully trim away the extraneous branches and add a little magical glamour to complete the illusion.

 

[ra] "Oh. Oh, it's lovely."

[m] She deftly slipped past him to examine his work more closely.

[ra] "Did you add a little sparkle to it, too?"

 

[bb] "You actually shaded yours,"

[m] he observed, whistling appreciatively at her topiary sculpture.

[m] The two tones of his cutie mark were copied in distinct shades of green.

 

[bb] "You didn't peek, did you?"

[m] she asked, teasing him as she rounded the sculpture.

 

[bb] "As if I would need to."

[m] He rounded and escorted her back into the open.

[bb] "One glance was all it took."

 

_sc_00011  (gardens but away from most of the gala – other angle, evening,  day 46++)

 

 

[m] Rarity blushed, having only shown her mark to him for a few seconds before they began making the sculptures.

[m] She'd genuinely surprised him tonight: even acting rather un-princely, she'd stuck around. He wasn't sure if it was tenacity or what. She was so stubborn in certain ways.

 

[bb] "Miss Rarity."

[m] He broached a topic that had bothered him before.

[bb] "I've wanted to ask you, for a while now: why me? Out of all the stallions you could have been with tonight? Why is it me?"

 

[ra] "Oh."

[m] Her eyes darted away as she tried to avoid the question.

 

[bb] "Is it because I'm the... a Prince?"

[bb]  "Is it because you read about me in some tabloid and caught your fancy?"

 

[m] The strangest thing was that, at some point, he had come to want to believe it was more than that.

 

[ra] "I'd be lying if that wasn't a factor in it,"

[m]  he sighed, expecting that answer.

 

[bb] "I see," he muttered.

 

[ra]] "You aren't what I read about,"

[m] she said, and his ears pricked.

 

[bb] "I'm not?"

[m] he asked, walking around her.

 

[ra] "Well, all those articles painted you as the most elite of the elite,"

[m] she continued, grinning as he feigned appearing aghast. She shook a bare hoof in the air.

[ra] "Prince Blueblood the fifty-second. Lord Grand Veneur. Most eligible bachelor in Canterlot. Destined to marry any number of the nobility's finest. A unicorn of impeccable taste and unmatched refinement."

 

[bb] "Actually, that does sound like me," he admitted with a chuckle.

 

[ra] "Nothing mentioned dancing, or... what was it? The 'sea pony swim'? Much less gardening and common topiary."

[m]  Rarity's blue eyes danced with mirth.

 

[ra] "Do you know what I expected?"

[ra] "I expected to spend the night stargazing, talking about art and being toured around the Palace."

 

[m] He breathed in the brisk night air, suppressing a laugh.

 

[bb] "We do sponsor half the artists in the country, and Auntie needs a place to store it all."

[m] Blueblood looked up and raised a hoof to eye level.

[bb] "And it is a nice, clear night."

 

[m] His gaze drifted from the stars to his company for the night, and grew serious.

[bb] "Miss Rarity. You should know that I was never the pony you imagined me to be. If you had met me on a bad day, I think you would have been... very disappointed. The truth is that I've enjoyed driving mares away. I've enjoyed rubbing their faces in what I'm not."

 

[m] She didn't seem thrown or put off by the supposed revelation.

 

[m] Instead, Rarity watched him carefully and asked,

[ra] "And why didn't you? You seem to know every pony at the Gala. You knew who I was. Why am I any different? Is it because I'm one of Twilight's friends?"

[m]  Her face darkened just a little, like passing under the shadow of a cloud.

[ra] "Is it because I happen to be one of the Elements of Harmony?"

 

[m] Blueblood's demeanor changed, becoming pensive.

 

[bb] "Thinking back..."

[m] And the way he said it, it was as if it was years ago and not hours.

[bb] "I think it was because you were the most beautiful mare in the Gala... and because I knew you were interested in me. It had nothing to do with Harmony. Or fame. Or honor."

 

[m] He gave a ragged sigh, his words and memories distasteful.

[bb] "When I was little, and other ponies used to use blocks to make castles and towers, I was the one who picked the nicest one... and kicked it. That was so long ago... but I still feel that part of me, in here."

[m] He tapped his chest, and frowned.

[bb] "I think that's what Auntie meant before. That's what she meant."

 

[m] The silence between them stretched on, until Rarity touched her hoof over his.

 

[ra] "I don't believe you're that kind of pony anymore."

[m] She said it honestly, candidly.

[ra] "And since you don't seem to be the Prince your press paints you to be, I think it proper I find out the real you."

 

[bb] "Then let me show you something."

 

_sc_00012  (gardens – hedge labyrinth , late evening,  day 46++)

 

[m] Even as the night deepened, he took her into the Garden labyrinth.

 

[m] he led her to the small, secluded center of the maze.

 

[m] It was the Blueblood Family monument: a clean, pyramidal obelisk.

 

[m] (maybe it would be worth it to make it in blender, a 3d grease pencil to look like it’s 2d?)

 

[m] On it, the names of fifty three Bluebloods were engraved, from the first, to his name, to the name of his son or daughter. All were Blueblood.

 

[bb] "The day I got my cutie mark, I found my name on this stone. Right here."

[m] He reared up to press the tip of his hoof to a name half-way down the monument.

[bb] "Each side holds ninety names. This monument is meant to honor three hundred and sixty generations of Bluebloods. I got my cutie mark when I discovered my place in the world. Right here."

[m] He tapped his name in the stone.

[bb] "Right here."

 

[bb] "I used to think this was me."

[m] He dropped back down to all fours.

[bb] "And I don't think I ever told anypony that before."

 

[ra] "But you shared it with me."

[m] Rarity, the Element of Generosity, pulled him away from the monument.

[ra] "Why? I know it isn't just because you see me as a tower of blocks to knock over,"

[m] she gently ribbed him.

[ra] "Tell me. Please?"

 

[bb] "Because... because I had fun tonight,"

[m]  he admitted, facing her and not the future or the past.

[bb] "Here with you, I'm not thinking about tomorrow."

[m] His smile became tinged with melancholy.

[bb] "That probably sounds so mundane, but it means everything to me right now."

 

[ra] "I think I understand,"

[m] she said, leaning close to him for warmth.

[ra] "Tonight was the most wonderful night of my life. Tomorrow can take care of itself."

 

[m] (firework effect will need to be nice looking)

 

[m] Overhead, fireworks exploded, filling the night sky with a sudden brief bloom of red and orange while a distant orchestra played Entry of the Princess into Light.

[m]  Rarity turned her chin up, and Blueblood dipped down, stealing a quick, chaste touch of her lips.

[m] The pair stood for a short time, until a cool breeze blew in from under the moon.

[m] In the night sky, a trio of pegasi swirled, a rainbow streak against the horizon flanked by jets of light and fire.

 

[bb] "Miss Rarity. I'll teleport us inside if you say 'please.'"

 

[ra] "Honestly, Prince Blueblood. Making a lady beg is most unc –"

 

[m] Pop!

 

 

[m] (maybe have the labyrinth garden presented on its own and have the rd + 2 others fly by the moon to symbolically show that things are different?)

[m] (than do a switch and bait of showing the fade to black and credit roll, than as the text scrolls the radio song starts to play than the following scene goes up?)

 

 

 

_sc_00013  (bedchamber, early morning,  day 47_end of loop)

 

[m] (song)

 

 

 

[m] Blueblood found himself on his back, eyes bleary but open, staring up at the delicately tiled ceiling. The same: the same ceiling as always.

[m]  Slowly closing his eyes, he sighed, a single, long lamentable breath that sapped the energy from his body.

[m] He began to reach out to turn off the damnable contraption.

 

[m] (song continues)

 

[ra] "Ugh, really, darling? You listen to this music, too?"

 

[m] A soft white front leg swung across his chest, fumbling for a second before turning the radio off.

[m]  It then retracted, bumping into his cheek along the way, as a body moved to his right, pulling away a corner of the blanket.

[[m] A voice muttered something about 'a good customer, but an overrated musician.'

 

[m] Turning slowly, Blueblood sniffed as a violet mane filled his vision.

 

[m] Shooting upright, he gazed long and hard at the mare lying next to him, still in her Gala dress.

 

[m] Tentatively, he reached out and poked her side.

 

[m] She felt real. Genuinely, really-real. Still not entirely convinced he hadn't just gone mad – madder anyway – he sat still and watched her for a while.

[m]  Rarity stirred, having already been sufficiently disturbed by the radio, and rolled onto her other side.

[m] Blue eyes fluttered open and gazed up at him.

 

[ra] "What?"

[m] she asked, catching him staring, and smiled.

 

[bb] "You're here,"

[m] he whispered, wonderingly.

[bb] "You're still here?"

 

[m] She blinked again, starting to frown –

 

[m] He quickly ducked down and kissed her, first on the lips and then just below the horn.

 

[bb] "You're still here,"

[m] he said again, marveling at that fact.

 

[m] Before she could reply, looking somewhere between confused and pleased, he kissed her again.

[m] What had been with the hesitation of a pony expecting a mirage to disappear the moment it came in reach now turned into the relieved intoxication of a drowning pony finally on the verge of rescue.

[m]  Rarity cooed and then chirped as he nipped her ear.

 

[ra] "Prince Blueblood! Really!"

 

[m] He sighed into her hair, and kissed her on the nose.

[bb] "Miss Rarity... yesterday was the longest day of my life. You'll forgive me for feeling a little frisky."

 

[m] Not quite understanding, she watched him with wide eyes.

 

[m] Never once had he seen her in the morning before. She was breathtaking.

 

 

_sc_00014  (dinner hall, morning,  day 47_end of loop)

 

 

[m] At the royal table, the Princess Luna sipped from her glass of dinner wine.

[m] The night had been quite tiring, for once, and she was looking forward to a good long nap while her sister managed the day.

[m] She wondered how some ponies, and some creatures like Miss Sparkle's dragon assistant, could manage to have so much energy, cavorting around the castle at all hours.

 

[m] So many ponies had stayed up, even after the end of the Gala; some just milling about, others having fun.

 

[m] Sitting close by, Luna's older sister nibbled on a plate of yucca fruits.

 

[Lun] "Where do you suppose Blueblood's gotten to?"

[m] she wondered, having neither seen nor heard him this morning.

[m] Luna gave her sister a look.

[Lun]  "And what's with that grin?"

 

[m] Celestia studiously sipped from her cup of tea.

"It's been some time..."

 

Light Touch glanced up at the clock. It was almost eleven. Almost noon! Listening to the radio, once again playing Equestria Girls, her quiet partner Sandy didn't look up from where she lay on a sitting pillow.

 

"The Prince is usually awake by now," the older mare muttered, a bit worried. "I don't understand, isn't he going to call for us?"

 

Sandy shook her head; the timid filly had only one thing to say:

 

"Not today."

 

 

 

 

[m] (retcon her asking for the apple stuff in the previous loop, so this will be her last words)

A/N

For the curious:

I imagined the piece Celestia and Blueblood danced to, to be akin to "Schubert's 'Fantasie' in C major, aka the 'Wanderer Fantasy' for Piano & Orchestra."

 

Which then became a slower piece like "Concierto de Aranjuez" when Rarity and Blueblood danced.

 

I think I've let my personal love of classic music seep into this fic a bit too much.

 

 

Of course we mustn’t forget another classic:

"Twist it, Shake it" (Shake Your Tail Feather)

Ray Charles (1930-2004) (RIP)

[oc-prof] the wrinkled old pony - Professor Whitemane - The wrinkled old codger had to be pushing a century or more. Somehow. Yet he was as sharp and spry as a stallion half his age. Magic could do that for a pony. Of course, rumor was that Old Whitemane dabbled in alchemy, and forbidden 'mercury flavored' cupcakes. His name had lately become quite ironic: the Professor was bald, save for the short white beard on his chin.

- Whitemane was notoriously abrasive towards all his students. He treated his apprentices even worse, or so the college rumor mill claimed.
